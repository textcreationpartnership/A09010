            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the ancient Heathens did appropriate the fir≈øt inuention of the knowledge of Herbes, and ≈øo con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of Phy≈øicke, ≈øome vnto <hi>Chiron</hi> the Centaure, and others vnto <hi>Apollo</hi> or
<hi>Aeculapius</hi> his ≈øonne; yet wee that are Chri≈øtians haue out of a better Schoole learned, that God, the Creator of Heauen and Earth, at the beginning when he created <hi>Adam,</hi> inspired him with the knowledge of all naturall things (which ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øsiuely de≈øcended to <hi>Noah</hi> afterwardes, and to his Posterity): for, as he was able to giue names to all the liuing Creatures, according to their ≈øeuerall natures; ≈øo no doubt but hee had al≈øo the knowledge, both what Herbes and Fruits were fit, eyther for Meate or Medicine, for V≈øe or for Delight. And that <hi>Adam</hi> might exerci≈øe this knowledge, God planted a Garden for him to liue in, (wherein euen in his innocency he was to labour and ≈øpend his time) which hee ≈øtored with the best and choy≈øe≈øt Herbes and Fruits the earth could produce, that he might haue not onely for nece≈øsitie whereon to feede, but for plea≈øure al≈øo; the place or garden called Paradi≈øe importing as much, and more plainly the words ≈øet downe in <hi>Gene≈øis</hi> the ≈øecond, which are the≈øe; <hi>Out of the ground the Lord God made to grow euerie tree plea≈øant to the ≈øight and good for meate;</hi> and in the <hi>24.</hi> of
<hi>Numbers,</hi> the Parable of Balaam, mentioning the Aloe trees that God planted; and in other places if there were neede to recite them. But my purpo≈øe is onely to ≈øhew you, that Paradi≈øe was a place (whether you will call it a Garden, or Orchard, or both, no doubt of ≈øome large extent) wherein
<hi>Adam</hi> was fir≈øt placed to abide; that God was the Planter thereof, hauing furni≈øhed it with trees and herbes, as well plea≈øant to the ≈øight, as good for meate, and that hee being to dre≈ø≈øe and keepe this place, mu≈øt of nece≈øsity know all the things that grew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to what v≈øes they ≈øerued, or el≈øe his labour about them, and knowledge in them, had been in vaine. And although <hi>Adam</hi> lost the place for his tran≈øgre≈øsion, yet he lo≈øt not the naturall knowledge, nor v≈øe of them: but that, as God made the whole world, and all the Creatures therein for Man, ≈øo hee may v≈øe all things as well of plea≈øure as of nece≈øsitie, to bee helpes vnto him to ≈øerue his God. Let men therefore, according to their fir≈øt in≈øtitution, ≈øo v≈øe their ≈øeruice, that they al≈øo in them may remember their ≈øeruice to God, and not (like our Grand-mother <hi>Eve</hi>) ≈øet their affections ≈øo ≈øtrongly on the plea≈øure in them, as to de≈øerue the lo≈ø≈øe of them in this Paradi≈øe, yea and of Heauen al≈øo. For truly from all ≈øorts of Herbes and Flowers we may draw matter at all times not only to magnifie the Creator that hath giuen them ≈øuch diuer≈øities of formes, ≈øents and colours, that the mo≈øt cunning
<pb facs="tcp:15790:4"/> Worke-man cannot imitate, and ≈øuch vertues and properties, that although wee know many, yet many more lye hidden and vnknowne, but many good in≈øtructions al≈øo to our ≈øelues: That as many herbes and flowers with their fragrant ≈øweete ≈ømels doe comfort, and as it were reuiue the ≈øpirits, and perfume a whole hou≈øe; euen ≈øo ≈øuch men as liue vertuou≈øly, labouring to doe good, and profit the Church of God and the Common wealth by their paines or penne, doe as it were ≈øend forth a plea≈øing ≈øauour of ≈øweet in≈øtructions, not only to that time wherein they liue, and are fre≈øh, but being drye, withered and dead, cea≈øe not in all after ages to doe as much or more. Many herbes and flowers that haue ≈ømall beautie or ≈øauour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, haue much more good v≈øe and vertue: ≈øo many men of excellent rare parts and good qualities doe lye hid vnknown and not re≈øpected, vntill time and v≈øe of them doe ≈øet forth their properties. Againe, many flowers haue a glorious ≈øhew of beauty and brauery, yet ≈øtinking in ≈ømell, or el≈øe of no other v≈øe: ≈øo many doe make a glorious o≈øtentation, and flouri≈øh in the world, when as if they ≈øtinke not horribly before God, and all good men, yet ≈øurely they haue no other vertue then their out≈øide to commend them, or leaue behind them. Some al≈øo ri≈øe vp and appear like a Lilly among Thornes, or as a goodly Flower among many Weedes or Gra≈ø≈øe, eyther by their honourable authoritie, or eminence of learning or riches, whereby they excell others, and thereby may doe good to many. The frailty al≈øo of Mans life is learned by the ≈øoone fading of them before their flowring, or in their pride, or ≈øoone after, being either cropt by the hand of the ≈øpectator, or by a ≈øudden bla≈øt wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and parched, or by the reuolution of time decaying of it owne nature: as al≈øo that the faire≈øt flowers or fruits fir≈øt ripe, are ≈øoone≈øt and fir≈øt gathered. The mutabilitie al≈øo of ≈øtates and per≈øons, by this, that as where many goodly flowers &amp; fruits did grow this yeare and age, in another they are quite pulled or digged vp, and eyther weedes and gra≈ø≈øe grow in their place, or ≈øome building erected thereon, and their place is no more known. The Ciuill re≈øpects to be learned from them are many al≈øo: for the delight of the varieties both of formes, colours and properties of Herbes and Flowers, hath euer beene powerfull ouer dull, vnnurtured, ru≈øticke and ≈øauage people, led only by Natures in≈øtinct; how much

               </gap> powerfull is it, or ≈øhould be in the mindes of generous per≈øons? for it may well bee ≈øaid, he is not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, that is not allured with this obiect. The ≈øtudy, knowledge, and trauel in them, as they haue been entertained of great Kings, Princes and Potentates, without di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to their Greatne≈ø≈øe, or hinderance to their more ≈øerious and weighty Affaires: ≈øo no doubt vnto all that are capable thereof, it is not onely plea≈øant, but profitable, by comforting the minde, ≈øpirits and ≈øen≈øes with an harmele≈ø≈øe delight, and by enabling the iudgement to conferre and apply helpe to many dangerous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øea≈øes. It is al≈øo an In≈øtructer in the verity of the genuine Plants of the Ancients, and a Correcter of the many errours whereunto the world by continuance hath bin diuerted, and almo≈øt therein fixed, by eradicating in time, and by degrees, the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious wilfulne≈ø≈øe of many, who becau≈øe they were brought vp in their errours, are mo≈øt vnwilling to leaue them without con≈øideration of the good or euill, the right or wrong, they draw on therewith. And for my ≈øelfe I may well ≈øay, that had not mine owne paines and ≈øtudies by a naturall inclination beene more powerfull in mee then any others helpe (although ≈øome through an euill di≈øpo≈øition and ignorance haue ≈øo far traduced me as to ≈øay this was rather another mans worke then mine owne, but I leaue them to their folly) I had neuer done ≈øo much as I here publi≈øh; nor been fit or prepared for a larger, as time may ≈øuddenly (by Gods permi≈øsion) bring to light, if the maleuolent di≈øpo≈øitions of degenerate ≈øpirits doe not hinder the accompli≈øhment. <pb facs="tcp:15790:4"/> But per≈øwading my ≈øelfe there is no ≈øhowre that produceth not ≈øome fruit, or no word but worketh ≈øome effect, eyther of good to per≈øwade, or of reproofe to euince; I could not but declare my minde herein, let others iudge or ≈øay what they plea≈øe. For I haue alwaies held it a thing vnfit, to conceale or bury that knowledge God hath giuen, and not to impart it, and further others therewith as much as is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, yet without ostentation, which I haue euer hated. Now further to informe the courteous Reader, both of the occa≈øion that led me on to this worke, and the other occurrences to it. Fir≈øt, hauing peru≈øed many Herbals in Latine, I ob≈øerued that mo≈øt of them haue eyther neglected or not knowne the many diuer≈øities of the flower Plants, and rare fruits are known to vs at this time, and (except <hi>Clu≈øius</hi>) haue made mention but of a very few. In Engli≈øh likewi≈øe we haue ≈øome extant, as
<hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> tran≈ølated, who haue haue ≈øaid little of Flowers, <hi>Gerard</hi> who is la≈øt, hath no doubt giuen vs the knowledge of as many as he attained vnto in his time, but ≈øince his daies we haue had many more varieties, then he or they euer heard of, as may be perceiued by the ≈øtore I haue here produced. And none of them haue particularly ≈øeuered tho≈øe that are beautifull flower plants, fit to ≈øtore a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of delight and plea≈øure, from the wilde and vnfit: but haue enterlaced many, one among another, whereby many that haue de≈øired to haue faire flowers, haue not known either what to choo≈øe, or what to de≈øire. Diuers Bookes of Flowers al≈øo haue been ≈øet forth, ≈øome in our owne Countrey, and more in others, all which are as it were but handfuls ≈ønatched from the plentifull Trea≈øury of Nature, none of them being willing or able to open all ≈øorts, and declare them fully; but the greate≈øt hinderance of all mens delight was, that none of them had giuen any de≈øcription of them, but the bare name only. To ≈øatisfie therefore their de≈øires that are louers of ≈øuch Delights, I took vpon me this labour and charge, and haue here ≈øelected and ≈øet forth a Garden of all the chiefe≈øt for choyce, and faire≈øt for ≈øhew, from among all the ≈øeuerall Tribes and Kindreds of Natures beauty, and haue ranked them as neere as I could, or as the worke would permit, in affinity one vnto another. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for their ≈øakes that are ≈øtudious in Authors, I haue ≈øet down the names haue bin formerly giuen vnto them, with ≈øome of their errours, not intending to cumber this worke with all that might bee ≈øaid of them, becau≈øe the deciding of the many controuer≈øies, doubts, and que≈øtions that concerne them, pertaine more fitly to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Hi≈øtory: yet I haue beene in ≈øome places more copious and ample then at the fir≈øt I had intended, the occa≈øion drawing on my de≈øire to informe others with what I thought was fit to be known, re≈øeruing what el≈øe might be ≈øaid to another time &amp; worke; wherein (God willing) I will inlarge my ≈øelfe, the ≈øubiect matter requiring it at my hands, in what my ≈ømall ability can effect. Thirdly, I haue al≈øo to embelli≈øh this Worke ≈øet forth the figures of all ≈øuch plants and flowers as are materiall and different one from another: but not as ≈øome others haue done, that is, a number of the figures of one ≈øort of plant that haue nothing to di≈øtingui≈øh them but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, for that I hold to be ≈øuperfluous and wa≈øte. Fourthly, I haue al≈øo ≈øet down the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ertues and Properties of them in a briefe manner, rather de≈øiring to giue you the knowledge of a few certaine and true, then to relate, as others haue done, a needle≈øs and fal≈øe multiplicitie, that ≈øo there might as well profit as plea≈øure be taken from them, and that nothing might be wanting to accompli≈øh it fully. And ≈øo much for this fir≈øt part, my Garden of plea≈øant and delightfull Flowers. My next Garden con≈øi≈øteth of Herbes and Rootes, fit to be eaten of the rich and poor as nouri≈øhment and food, as ≈øawce or condiment, as ≈øallet or refre≈øhing, for plea≈øure or profit; where I doe as well play the Gardiner, to ≈øhew you (in briefe, but not at large) the times <pb facs="tcp:15790:5"/> and manner of ≈øowing, ≈øetting, planting, replanting, and the like (although all the≈øe things, and many more then are true, are ≈øet down very largely in the ≈øeuerall bookes that others haue written of this ≈øubiect) as al≈øo to ≈øhew ≈øome of the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen v≈øes (becau≈øe they are Kitchen herbes &amp;c.) although I confe≈ø≈øe but very ≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, not intending a treati≈øe of cookery, but briefly to giue a touch thereof; and al≈øo the Phy≈øicall properties, to ≈øhew ≈øomewhat that others haue not ≈øet forth; yet not to play the Empericke, and giue you receipts of medicines for all di≈øea≈øes, but only to ≈øhew in ≈øome ≈øort the qualities of Herbes, to quicken the minds of the ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. And la≈øtly an Orchard of all ≈øorts of dome≈øticke or forraine, rare and good fruits, fit for this our Land and Countrey, which is at this time better ≈øtored and furni≈øhed then euer in any age before. I haue herein endeauoured, as in the other Gardens, to ≈øet forth the varieties of euery ≈øort in as briefe a manner as po≈øsibly could be, without ≈øuperfluous repetitions of de≈øcriptions, and onely with e≈øpeciall notes of difference in leaues, flowers and fruits. Some few properties al≈øo are ≈øet downe, rather the chiefe≈øt then the mo≈øt, as the worke did require. And moreouer before euery of the≈øe parts I haue giuen Treati≈øes of the ordering, preparing and keeping the ≈øeuerall Gardens and Orchard, with what≈øoeuer I thought was conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to be known for euery of them.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I ≈øhewed you both the occa≈øion and ≈øcope of this Worke, and herein haue ≈øpent my time, paines and charge, which if well accepted, I ≈øhall thinke well employed, and may the ≈øooner ha≈øten the fourth Part, A Garden of Simples; which will be quiet no longer at home, then that it can bring his Ma≈øter newes of faire weather for the iourney.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ≈øeuerall ≈øituations of mens dwellings, are for the mo≈øt part vnauoideable and vnremoueable; for mo≈øt men cannot appoint forth ≈øuch a manner of ≈øituation for their dwelling, as is mo≈øt fit to auoide all the inconueniences of winde and weather, but mu≈øt bee content with ≈øuch as the place will afford them; yet all men doe well know, that ≈øome ≈øituations are more excellent than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: according therfore to the ≈øeuerall ≈øituation of mens dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ≈øo are the ≈øituations of their gardens al≈øo for the mo≈øt part. And although diuers doe diuer≈øly preferre their owne ≈øeuerall places which they haue cho≈øen, or wherein they dwell. As ≈øome tho≈øe places that are neare vnto a riuer or brooke to be be≈øt for the plea≈øantne≈ø≈øe of the water, the ca≈øe of tran≈øportation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, their friends and goods, as al≈øo for the fertility of the ≈øoyle, which is ≈øeldome bad neare vnto a riuers ≈øide; And others extoll the ≈øide or top of an hill, bee it ≈ømall or great, for the pro≈øpects ≈øake; And againe, ≈øome the plaine or champian ground, for the euen leuell thereof: euery one of which, as they haue their commodities accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them, ≈øo haue they al≈øo their di≈øcommodities belonging vnto them, according to the Latine Prouerbe, <hi>Omne commodum fert ≈øuum incommodum.</hi> Yet to ≈øhew you for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the≈øe ≈øituations which is the fitte≈øt place to plant your garden in, and how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from the iniuries of the cold windes and fro≈øts that may annoy it, will, I hope, be well accepted. And fir≈øt, for the water ≈øide, I ≈øuppo≈øe the North ≈øide of the water to be the be≈øt ≈øide for your garden, that it may haue the comfort of the South Sunne to lye vpon it and face it, and the dwelling hou≈øe to bee aboue it, to defend the cold windes and fro≈øts both from your herbes, and flowers, and early fruits. And ≈øo likewi≈øe I iudge for the hill ≈øide, that it may lye full open to the South Sunne, and the hou≈øe aboue it, both for the comfort the ground ≈øhall receiue of the water and raine de≈øcending into it, and of defence from winter and colds. Now for the plaine leuell ground, the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the hou≈øe ≈øhould be on the North ≈øide of the garden, that ≈øo they might bee a defence of much ≈øufficiency to ≈øafeguard it from many iniurious cold nights and dayes, which el≈øe might ≈øpoyle the pride thereof in the bud. But becau≈øe euery one cannot ≈øo appoint his dwelling, as I here appoint the fitte≈øt place for it to be, euery ones plea≈øure thereof ≈øhall be according to the ≈øite, co≈øt, and endeauours they be≈øtow, to cau≈øe it come neare≈øt to this proportion, by ≈øuch helpes of bricke or ≈øtone wals to defend it, or by the helpe of high growne and well ≈øpread trees, planted on the North ≈øide thereof, to keepe it the warmer. And euery of the≈øe three ≈øituations, hauing the faire≈øt buildings of the hou≈øe facing the garden in this manner before ≈øpecified, be≈øides the benefit of ≈øhelter it ≈øhall haue from them, the buildings and roomes abutting thereon, ≈øhall haue recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the beautifull pro≈øpect into it, and haue both ≈øight and ≈øent of what≈øoeuer is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and worthy to giue content out from it, which is one of the greate≈øt plea≈øures a garden can yeeld his Ma≈øter. Now hauing ≈øhewed you the be≈øt place where this your <pb n="2" facs="tcp:15790:8"/> garden ≈øhould be, let me likewi≈øe adui≈øe you where it ≈øhould not be, at lea≈øt that it is the wor≈øt place wherein it may be, if it be either on the We≈øt or Ea≈øt ≈øide of your hou≈øe, or that it ≈øtand in a moori≈øh ground, or other vnwhol≈øome ayre (for many, both fruits, herbes, and flowers that are tender, participate with the ayre, taking in a manner their chiefe≈øt thriuing from thence) or neare any common Lay-≈øtalles, or common Sewers, or el≈øe neare any great Brew-hou≈øe, Dye-hou≈øe, or any other place where there is much ≈ømoake, whether it be of ≈øtraw, wood, or e≈øpecially of ≈øea-coales, which of all other is the wor≈øt, as our Citie of London can giue proofe ≈øufficient, wherein neither herbe nor tree will long pro≈øper, nor hath done euer ≈øince the v≈øe of ≈øea-coales beganne to bee fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent therein. And likewi≈øe that it is much the wor≈øe, if it bee neare vnto any Barnes or Stackes of corne or hey, becau≈øe that from thence will continually with the winde bee brought into the garden the ≈øtrawe and chaffe of the corne, the du≈øt and ≈øeede of the hey to choake or pe≈øter it. Next vnto the place or ≈øituation, let mee ≈øhew you the grounds or ≈øoyles for it, eyther naturall or artificiall. No man will deny, but the naturall blacke mould is not only the fatte≈øt and riche≈øt, but farre exceedeth any other either naturall or artificiall, as well in goodne≈ø≈øe as durability. And next thereunto, I hold the ≈øandy loame (which is light and yet firme, but not loo≈øe as ≈øand, nor ≈øtiffe like vnto clay) to be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferiour for this our Garden of plea≈øure; for that it doth cau≈øe all bulbous and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berous rooted plants to thriue ≈øufficiently therein, as likewi≈øe all other flower-plants, Ro≈øes, Trees, &amp;c. which if it ≈øhall decay by much turning and working out the heart of it, may ≈øoone be helped with old ≈øtable manure of hor≈øes, being well turned in, when it is old and almo≈øt conuerted to mould. Other grounds, as chalke, ≈øand, grauell, or clay, are euery of them one more or le≈ø≈øe fertill or barren than other; and therefore doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ≈øuch helpes as is mo≈øt fit for them. And tho≈øe grounds that are ouer dry, loo≈øe, and du≈øtie, the manure of ≈øtall fedde bea≈øts and cattell being buried or trenched into the earth, and when it is thorough rotten (which will require twice the time that the ≈øtable ≈øoyle of hor≈øes will) well turned and mixed with the earth, is the be≈øt ≈øoyle to temper both the heate and drine≈ø≈øe of them. So contrariwi≈øe the ≈øtable dung of hor≈øes is the be≈øt for cold grounds, to giue them heate and life. But of all other ≈øorts of grounds, the ≈øtiffe clay is the very wor≈øt for this purpo≈øe, for that although you ≈øhould digge out the whole compa≈ø≈øe of your Garden, carry it away, and bring other good mould in the ≈øtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and fill vp the place, yet the nature of that clay is ≈øo predominant, that in a ≈ømall time it will eate out the heart of the good mould, and conuert it to its owne nature, or very neare vnto it: ≈øo that to bring it to any good, there mu≈øt bee continuall labour be≈øtowed thereon, by bringing into it good ≈øtore of chalke, lime, or ≈øand, or el≈øe a≈øhes eyther of wood or of ≈øea-coales (which is the be≈øt for this ground) well mixed and turned in with it. And as this ≈øtiffe clay is the wor≈øt, ≈øo what ground ≈øoeuer commeth neare≈øt vnto the nature thereof, is neare≈øt vnto it in badne≈ø≈øe, the ≈øignes whereof are the ouermuch moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øture thereof in Winter, and the much cleauing and chapping thereof in Summer, when the heate of the yeare hath con≈øumed the moy≈øture, which tyed and bound it fa≈øt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as al≈øo the ≈øtiffe and hard working therein: but if the nature of the clay bee not too ≈øtiffe, but as it were tempered and mixed with ≈øand or other earths, your old ≈øtable ≈øoyle of hor≈øes will helpe well the ≈ømall rifting or chapping thereof, to be plentifully be≈øtowed therin in a fit ≈øea≈øon. Some al≈øo do commend the ca≈øting of ponds and ditches, to helpe to manure the≈øe ≈øtiffe chapping grounds. Other grounds, that are ouermoi≈øt by ≈øprings, that lye too neare the vpper face of the earth, be≈øides that the beds thereof had need to be laid vp higher, and the allies, as trenches and furrowes, to lye lower, the ground it ≈øelfe had neede to haue ≈øome good ≈øtore of chalke-≈øtones be≈øtowed thereon, ≈øome certaine yeares, if it may be, before it be laid into a Garden, that the Winter fro≈øts may breake the chalke ≈ømall, and the Raine di≈ø≈øolue it into mould, that ≈øo they may bee well mixed together; than which, there is not any better manure to ≈øoyle ≈øuch a moi≈øt ground, to helpe to dry vp the moy≈øture, and to giue heate and life to the coldne≈ø≈øe thereof, which doth alwayes accompany the≈øe moi≈øt grounds, and al≈øo to cau≈øe it abide longer in heart than any other. For the ≈øandy and grauelly grounds, although I know the well mollified manure of bea≈øts and cattell to be excellent good, yet I know al≈øo, that ≈øome commend a white Marle, and ≈øome a clay to be well ≈øpread thereon, and after tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereinto: and for the chalkie ground, <hi>√® conuer≈øo,</hi> I commend fatte clay to helpe it. You mu≈øt vnder≈øtand, that the le≈ø≈øe rich or more barren that your ground is, there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <pb n="3" facs="tcp:15790:8"/> the more care, labour, and co≈øt to bee be≈øtowed thereon, both to order it rightly, &amp; ≈øo to pre≈øerue it from time to time: for no artificiall or forc't ground can endure good any long time, but that within a few yeares it mu≈øt be refre≈øhed more or le≈ø≈øe, according as it doth require. Yet you ≈øhall likewi≈øe vnder≈øtand, that this Garden of plea≈øure ≈øtored with the≈øe Out-landi≈øh flowers; that is, bulbous and tuberous rooted plants, and other fine flowers, that I haue hereafter de≈øcribed, and a≈ø≈øigned vnto it, needeth not ≈øo much or ≈øo often manuring with ≈øoyle, &amp;c. as another Garden planted with the other ≈øorts of Engli≈øh flowers, or a Garden of ordinary Kitchin herbes doth. Your ground likewi≈øe for this Garden had neede to bee well clean≈øed from all annoyances (that may hinder the well doing or pro≈øpering of the flowers therein) as ≈øtones, weedes, rootes of trees, bu≈øhes, &amp;c. and all other things cumber≈øome or hurtfull; and therefore the earth being not naturally fine enough of it ≈øelfe, is v≈øed to bee ≈øifted to make it the finer, and that either through a hurdle made of ≈øticks, or lathes, or through ≈øquare or round ≈øieues plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with fine and ≈øtrong thin ≈øtickes, or with wyers in the bottome. Or el≈øe the whole earth of the Garden being cour≈øe, may be ca≈øt in the ≈øame manner that men v≈øe to try or fine ≈øand from grauell, that is, again≈øt a wall; whereby the cour≈øer and more ≈øtony, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe from the fine, is to betaken away from the foote of the heape, the finer ≈øand and ground remaining ≈øtill aboue, and on the heape. Or el≈øe in the want of a wall to ca≈øt it again≈øt, I haue ≈øeene earth fined by it ≈øelfe in this manner: Hauing made the floore or vpper part of a large plat of ground cleane from ≈øtones, &amp;c. let there a rea≈øonable round heape of fine earth be ≈øet in the mid≈øt thereof, or in≈øtead thereof a large Garden flower-pot, or other great pot, the bottome turned vpwards, and then poure your cour≈øe earth on the top or head thereof, one ≈øhouell full after another ≈øomewhat gently, and thereby all the cour≈øe ≈øtuffe and ≈øtones will fall downe to the bottome round about the heape, which mu≈øt continually be carefully taken away, and thus you may make your earth as fine as if it were ca≈øt again≈øt a wall, the heape being growne great, ≈øeruing in ≈øtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Tho≈øe that will not prepare their grounds in ≈øome of the≈øe manners afore≈øaid, ≈øhall ≈øoone finde to their lo≈ø≈øe the neglect thereof: for the tra≈øh and ≈øtones ≈øhall ≈øo hinder the encrea≈øe of their roots, that they will be halfe lo≈øt in the earth among the ≈øtones, which el≈øe might be ≈øaued to ≈øerue to plant where≈øoeuer they plea≈øe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The frame or forme of a Garden of delight and plea≈øure, with the ≈øeuerall varieties thereof.</head>
               <p>ALthough many men mu≈øt be content with any plat of ground, of what forme or quantity ≈øoeuer it bee, more or le≈ø≈øe, for their Garden, becau≈øe a more large or conuenient cannot bee had to their habitation: Yet I per≈øwade my ≈øelfe, that Gentlemen of the better ≈øort and quality, will prouide ≈øuch a parcell of ground to bee laid out for their Garden, and in ≈øuch conuenient manner, as may be fit and an≈øwerable to the degree they hold. To pre≈øcribe one forme for euery man to follow, were too great pre≈øumption and folly: for euery man will plea≈øe his owne fancie, according to the extent he de≈øigneth out for that purpo≈øe, be it orbicular or round, triangular or three ≈øquare, quadrangular or foure ≈øquare, or more long than broad. I will onely ≈øhew you here the ≈øeuerall formes that many men haue taken and delighted in, let euery man chu≈øe which him liketh be≈øt, or may mo≈øt fitly agree to that proportion of ground hee hath ≈øet out for that purpo≈øe. The orbicular or round forme is held in it owne proper exi≈øtence to be the mo≈øt ab≈øolute forme, containing within it all other formes what≈øoeuer; but few I thinke will chu≈øe ≈øuch a proportion to be ioyned to their habitation, being not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any where I think, but for the generall Garden to the Vniuer≈øity at Padoa. The tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular or three ≈øquare is ≈øuch a forme al≈øo, as is ≈øeldome cho≈øen by any that may make another choi≈øe, and as I thinke is onely had where another forme cannot be had, nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitie con≈øtraining them to be therewith content. The foure ≈øquare forme is the mo≈øt v≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accepted with all, and doth be≈øt agree to any mans dwelling, being (as I ≈øaid before) behinde the hou≈øe, all the backe windowes thereof opening into it. Yet if it bee longer than the breadth, or broader than the length, the proportion of walkes, ≈øquares, and knots may be ≈øoon brought to the ≈øquare forme, and be ≈øo ca≈øt, as the beauty thereof may <pb n="4" facs="tcp:15790:9"/>

To forme it therfore with walks, cro≈ø≈øe the middle both waies, and round about it al≈øo with hedges, with ≈øquares, knots and trayles, or any other worke within the foure ≈øquare parts, is according as euery mans conceit alloweth of it, and they will be at the charge: For there may be therein walkes eyther open or clo≈øe, eyther publike or priuate, a maze or wilderne≈ø≈øe, a rocke or mount, with a fountaine in the mid≈øt thereof to conuey water to euery part of the Garden, eyther in pipes vnder the ground, or brought by hand, and emptied into large Ci≈øternes or great Turkie Iarres, placed in conuenient places, to ≈øerue as an ea≈øe to water the neare≈øt parts thereunto. Arbours al≈øo being both gracefull and nece≈ø≈øary, may be appointed in ≈øuch conuenient places, as the corners, or el≈øe where, as may be mo≈øt fit, to ≈øerue both for ≈øhadow and re≈øt after walking. And becau≈øe many are de≈øirous to ≈øee the formes of trayles, knots, and other compartiments, and becau≈øe the open knots are more proper for the≈øe Out-landi≈øh flowers; I haue here cau≈øed ≈øome to be drawne, to ≈øatisfie their de≈øires, not intending to cumber this worke with ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, in that it would be almo≈øt endle≈ø≈øe, to expre≈ø≈øe ≈øo many as might bee conceiued and ≈øet downe, for that euery man may inuent others farre differing from the≈øe, or any other can be ≈øet forth. Let euery man therefore, if hee like of the≈øe, take what may plea≈øe his mind, or out of the≈øe or his own conceit, frame any other to his fancy, or cau≈øe others to be done as he liketh be≈øt, ob≈øeruing this
<hi>decorum,</hi> that according to his ground he do ca≈øt out his knots, with conuenient roome for allies and walkes; for the fairer and larger your allies and walkes be, the more grace your Garden ≈øhall haue, the le≈ø≈øe harme the herbes and flowers ≈øhall receiue, by pa≈ø≈øing by them that grow next vnto the allies ≈øides, and the better ≈øhall your Weeders clean≈øe both the beds and the allies.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The many ≈øorts of herbes and other things, wherewith the beds and parts of knots are bordered to ≈øet out the forme of them, with their commodities and di≈øcommodities.</head>
               <p>IT is nece≈ø≈øary al≈øo, that I ≈øhew you the ≈øeuerall materials, wherewith the≈øe knots and trayles are ≈øet forth and bordered; which are of two ≈øorts: The one are liuing herbes, and the other are dead materials; as leade, boords, bones, tyles, &amp;c. Of herbes, there are many ≈øorts wherewith the knots and beds in a Garden are v≈øed to bee ≈øet, to ≈øhew forth the forme of them, and to pre≈øerue them the longer in their forme, as al≈øo to be as greene, and ≈øweete herbes, while they grow, to be cut to perfume the hou≈øe, keeping them in ≈øuch order and proportion, as may be mo≈øt conuenient for their ≈øeuerall natures, and euery mans plea≈øure and fancy: Of all which, I intend to giue you the knowledge here in this place; and fir≈øt, to begin with that which hath beene mo≈øt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently receiued, which is Thrift. This is an euerliuing greene herbe, which many take to border their beds, and ≈øet their knots and trayles, and therein much delight, becau≈øe it will grow thicke and bu≈øhie, and may be kept, being cut with a paire of Garden ≈øheeres, in ≈øome good hand≈øome manner and proportion for a time, and be≈øides, in the Summer time ≈øend forth many ≈øhort ≈øtalkes of plea≈øant flowers, to decke vp an hou≈øe among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øweete herbes: Yet the≈øe inconueniences doe accompany it; it will not onely in a ≈ømall time ouergrow the knot or trayle in many places, by growing ≈øo thicke and bu≈øhie, that it will put out the forme of a knot in many places: but al≈øo much thereof will dye with the fro≈øts and ≈ønowes in Winter, and with the drought in Summer, whereby many voide places will be ≈øeene in the knot, which doth much deforme it, and mu≈øt therefore bee yearely refre≈øhed: the thickne≈ø≈øe al≈øo and bu≈øhing thereof doth hide and ≈øhelter ≈ønayles and other ≈ømall noy≈øome wormes ≈øo plentifully, that Gilloflowers, and other fine herbes and flowers being planted therein, are much ≈øpoyled by them, and cannot be helped without much indu≈øtry, and very great and daily attendance to de≈øtroy them. Germander is another herbe, in former times al≈øo much v≈øed, and yet al≈øo in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and becau≈øe it will grow thicke, and may be kept al≈øo in ≈øome forme and proportion with cutting, and that the cuttings are much v≈øed as a ≈øtrawing herbe for hou≈øes, being pretty and ≈øweete, is al≈øo much affected by diuers: but this al≈øo will often dye and grow out of forme, and be≈øides that, the ≈øtalkes will grow too great, hard and ≈øtubby, the rootes doe ≈øo farre ≈øhoote vnder ground, that vpon a little continuance thereof, will <pb n="6" facs="tcp:15790:10"/> ≈øpread into many places within the knot, which it continually they be not plucked vp, they will ≈øpoile the whole knot it ≈øelfe; and therefore once in three or foure yeares at the mo≈øt, it mu≈øt be taken vp and new ≈øet, or el≈øe it will grow too royni≈øh and cumber≈øome. Hy≈ø≈øope hath al≈øo been v≈øed to be ≈øet about a knot, and being ≈øweet, will ≈øerue for ≈øtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as Germander: But this, although the rootes doe not runne or creep like it, yet the ≈øtalkes doe quickly grow great aboue ground, and dye often after the fir≈øt yeares ≈øetting, whereby the grace of the knot will be much lo≈øt. Marierome, Sauorie, and Thyme, in the like manner being ≈øweete herbes, are v≈øed to border vp beds and knots, and will be kept for a little while, with cutting, into ≈øome conformity; but all and euery of them ≈øerue mo≈øt commonly but for one yeares v≈øe, and will ≈øoone decay and peri≈øh: and therefore none of the≈øe, no more than any of the former, doe I commend for a good bordering herbe for this purpo≈øe. Lauander Cotton al≈øo being finely ≈ølipped and ≈øet, is of many, and tho≈øe of the highe≈øt re≈øpect of late daies, accepted, both for the beauty and forme of the herbe, being of a whiti≈øh greene mealy colour, for his ≈øent ≈ømelling ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ≈øtrong, and being euerliuing and abiding greene all the Winter, will, by cutting, be kept in as euen proportion as any other herbe may be. This will likewi≈øe ≈øoone grow great and ≈øtubbed, notwith≈øtanding the cutting, and be≈øides will now and then peri≈øh in ≈øome places, e≈øpecially if you doe not ≈øtrike or put off the ≈ønow, before the Sunne lying vpon it di≈ø≈øolue it: The rarity &amp; nouelty of this herbe, being for the mo≈øt part but in the Gardens of great per≈øons, doth cau≈øe it to be of the greater regard, it mu≈øt therfore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed wholly euery ≈øecond or third yeare at the mo≈øt, becau≈øe of the great growing therof. Slips of Iuniper or Yew are al≈øo receiued of ≈øome &amp; planted, becau≈øe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes green, and that the Iuniper e≈øpecially hath not that ill ≈øent that Boxe hath, which I will pre≈øently commend vnto you, yet both Iuniper and Yew will ≈øoon grow too great and ≈øtubbed, and force you to take vp your knot ≈øooner, than if it were planted with Boxe. Which la≈øtly, I chiefly and aboue all other herbes commend vnto you, and being a ≈ømall, lowe, or dwarfe kinde, is called French or Dutch Boxe, and ≈øerueth very well to ≈øet out any knot, or border out any beds: for be≈øides that it is euer greene, it being rea≈øonable thicke ≈øet, will ea≈øily be cut and formed into any fa≈øhion one will, according to the nature thereof, which is to grow very ≈ølowly, and will not in a long time ri≈øe to be of any height, but ≈øhooting forth many ≈ømall branches from the roote, will grow very thicke, and yet not require ≈øo great tending, nor ≈øo much peri≈øh as any of the former, and is onely receiued into the Gardens of tho≈øe that are curious. This (as I before ≈øaid) I commend and hold to bee the be≈øt and ≈øure≈øt herbe to abide faire and greene in all the bitter ≈øtormes of the ≈øharpe≈øt Winter, and all the great heates and droughts of Summer, and doth recompence the want of a good ≈øweet ≈øent with his fre≈øh verdure, euen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and long la≈øting continuance. Yet the≈øe inconueniences it hath, that be≈øides the vnplea≈øing ≈øent which many mi≈ølike, and yet is but ≈ømall, the rootes of this Boxe do ≈øo much ≈øpread them≈øelues into the ground of the knot, and doe draw from thence ≈øo much nouri≈øhment, that it robbeth all the herbes that grow neare it of their ≈øap and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, thereby making all the earth about it barren, or at lea≈øt le≈ø≈øe fertile. Wherefore to ≈øhew you the remedy of this inconuenience of ≈øpreading, without either taking vp the Boxe of the border, or the herbes and flowers in the knot, is I thinke a ≈øecret knowne but vnto a few, which is this: You ≈øhall take a broad pointed Iron like vnto a Sli≈øe or Che≈ø≈øill, which thru≈øt downe right into the ground a good depth all along the in≈øide of the border of Boxe ≈øomewhat clo≈øe thereunto, you may thereby cut away the ≈øpreading rootes thereof, which draw ≈øo much moi≈øture from the other herbes on the in≈øide, and by this meanes both pre≈øerue your herbes and flowers in the knot, and your Boxe al≈øo, for that the Boxe will be nouri≈øhed ≈øufficiently from the re≈øt of the rootes it ≈øhooteth on all the other ≈øides. And thus much for the liuing herbes, that ≈øerue to ≈øet or border vp any knot. Now for the dead materials, they are al≈øo, as I ≈øaid before diuers: as fir≈øt, Leade, which ≈øome that are curious doe border their knots withall, cau≈øing it to be cut of the breadth of foure fingers, bowing the lower edge a little outward, that it may lye vnder the vpper cru≈øt of the ground, and that it may ≈øtand the fa≈øter, and making the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per edge either plain, or cut out like vnto the battlements of a Church: this fa≈øhion hath delighted ≈øome, who haue accounted it ≈øtately (at the lea≈øt co≈øtly) and fit for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and the rather, becau≈øe it will be bowed and bended into any round ≈øquare, angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or other proportion as one li≈øteth, and is not much to be mi≈øliked, in that the Leade <pb n="7" facs="tcp:15790:10"/> doth not ea≈øily breake or ≈øpoile without much iniury, and keepeth vp a knot for a very long time in his due proportion: but in my opinion, the Leade is ouer-hot for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ouer-cold for Winter. Others doe take Oaken inch boords, and ≈øawing them foure or fiue inches broad, do hold vp their knot therewith: but in that the≈øe boordes cannot bee drawne compa≈ø≈øe into any ≈ømall ≈øcantling, they mu≈øt ≈øerue rather for long outright beds, or ≈øuch knots as haue no rounds, halfe rounds, or compa≈ø≈øings in them. And be≈øides, the≈øe boordes are not long la≈øting, becau≈øe they ≈øtand continually in the weather, e≈øpecially the ends where they are fa≈øtned together will ≈øoone≈øt rot and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh, and ≈øo the whole forme will be ≈øpoyled. To preuent that fault, ≈øome others haue cho≈øen the ≈øhanke bones of Sheep, which after they haue beene well clean≈øed and boyled, to take out the fat from them, are ≈øtucke into the ground the ≈ømall end downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the knockle head vpwards, and thus being ≈øet ≈øide to ≈øide, or end to end clo≈øe together, they ≈øet out the whole knot therewith, which heads of bones although they looke not white the fir≈øt yeare, yet after they haue abiden ≈øome fro≈øts and heates will become white, and prettily grace out the ground: but this inconuenience is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them, that the Winter fro≈øts will rai≈øe them out of the ground oftentimes, and if by chance the knockle head of any doe breake, or be ≈øtrucke off with any ones foot, &amp;c. going by, from your ≈øtore, that lyeth by you of the ≈øame ≈øort, ≈øet another in the place, hauing fir≈øt taken away the broken peece: although the≈øe will la≈øt long in forme and order, yet becau≈øe they are but bones many mi≈ølike them, and indeed I know but few that v≈øe them. Tyles are al≈øo v≈øed by ≈øome, which by rea≈øon they may bee brought compa≈ø≈øe into any fa≈øhion many are plea≈øed with them, who doe not take the whole Tyle at length, but halfe Tyles, and other broken peeces ≈øet ≈øomewhat deepe into the ground, that they may ≈øtand fa≈øt, and the≈øe take vp but little roome, and keepe vp the edge of the beds and knots in a pretty comely manner, but they are often out of frame, in that many of them are broken and ≈øpoiled, both with mens feete pa≈ø≈øing by, the weather and weight of the earth beating them downe and breaking them, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially the fro≈øts in Winter doe ≈øo cracke off their edges, both at the toppes and ≈øides that ≈øtand clo≈øe one vnto another, that they mu≈øt bee continually tended and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, with fre≈øh and ≈øound ones put in the place of them that are broken or decayed. And la≈øtly (for it is the late≈øt inuention) round whiti≈øh or blewi≈øh pebble ≈øtones, of ≈øome rea≈øonable proportion and bigne≈ø≈øe, neither too great nor too little, haue beene v≈øed by ≈øome to be ≈øet, or rather in a manner but laide vpon the ground to fa≈øhion out the traile or knot, or all along by the large grauelly walke ≈øides to ≈øet out the walke, and maketh a pretty hand≈øome ≈øhew, and becau≈øe the ≈øtones will not decay with the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of any time or weather, and will be placed in their places againe, if any ≈øhould be thru≈øt out by any accident, as al≈øo that their ≈øight is ≈øo con≈øpicuous vpon the ground, e≈øpecially if they be not hid with the ≈øtore of herbes growing in the knot; is accounted both for durability, beauty of the ≈øight, hand≈øomne≈ø≈øe in the worke, and ea≈øe in the working and charge, to be of all other dead materials the chiefe≈øt. And thus, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I haue ≈øhewed you all the varieties that I know are v≈øed by any in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that are worth the reciting (but as for the fa≈øhion of Iawe-bones, v≈øed by ≈øome in the Low-Countries, and other places beyond the Seas, being too gro≈ø≈øe and ba≈øe, I make no mention of them) among which euery one may take what plea≈øeth him be≈øt, or may mo≈øt fitly be had, or may be≈øt agree with the ground or knot. Moreouer, all the≈øe herbes that ≈øerue for borderings, doe ≈øerue as well to be ≈øet vpon the ground of a leuelled knot; that is, where the allies and foot-pathes are of the ≈øame leuell with the knot, as they may ≈øerue al≈øo for the rai≈øed knot, that is, where the beds of the knot are rai≈øed higher than the allies: but both Leade, Boordes, Bones, and Tyles, are only for the rai≈øed ground, be it knot or beds. The pebble ≈øtones againe are onely for the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled ground, becau≈øe they are ≈øo ≈øhallow, that as I ≈øaid before, they rather lye vpon the earth than are thru≈øt any way into it. All this that I haue here ≈øet downe, you mu≈øt vnder≈øtand is proper for the knots alone of a Garden. But for to border the whole ≈øquare or knot about, to ≈øerue as a hedge thereunto, euery one taketh what liketh him be≈øt; as either Priuet alone, or ≈øweete Bryer, and white Thorne enterlaced together, and Ro≈øes of one, or two, or more ≈øorts placed here and there among≈øt them. Some al≈øo take Lauander, Ro≈øemary, Sage, Southernwood, Lauander Cotton, or ≈øome ≈øuch other thing. Some againe plant Cornell Trees, and pla≈øh them, or keepe them lowe, to <pb n="8" facs="tcp:15790:11"/> forme them into an hedge. And ≈øome againe take a lowe prickly ≈øhrubbe, that abideth alwayes greene, de≈øcribed in the end of this Booke, called in Latine
<hi>Pyracantha,</hi> which in time will make an euer greene hedge or border, and when it beareth fruit, which are red berries like vnto Hawthorne berries, make a glorious ≈øhew among the greene leaues in the Winter time, when no other ≈øhrubbes haue fruit or leaues.</p>

               <p>HAuing thus formed out a Garden, and diuided it into his fit and due proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with all the gracefull knots, arbours, walkes, &amp;c. likewi≈øe what is fit to keepe it in the ≈øame comely order, is appointed vnto it, both for the borders of the ≈øquares, and for the knots and beds them≈øelues; let vs now come and furni≈øh the inward parts, and beds with tho≈øe fine flowers that (being ≈øtrangers vnto vs, and giuing the beauty and brauery of their colours ≈øo early before many of our owne bred flowers, the more to entice vs to their delight) are mo≈øt be≈øeeming it: and namely, with Daffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dils, Fritillarias, Iacinthes, Saffron-flowers, Lillies, Flowerdeluces, Tulipas, Anemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, French Cow≈ølips, or Beares eares, and a number of ≈øuch other flowers, very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, delightfull, and plea≈øant, hereafter de≈øcribed at full, whereof although many haue little ≈øweete ≈øent to commend them, yet their earline≈ø≈øe and exceeding great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and varietie doth ≈øo farre counteruaile that defect (and yet I mu≈øt tell you with all, that there is among the many ≈øorts of them ≈øome, and that not a few, that doe excell in ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe, being ≈øo ≈øtrong and heady, that they rather offend by too much than by too little ≈øent, and ≈øome againe are of ≈øo milde and moderate temper, that they ≈øcarce come ≈øhort of your mo≈øt delicate and dantie≈øt flowers) that they are almo≈øt in all places with all per≈øons, e≈øpecially with the better ≈øort of the Gentry of the Land, as greatly de≈øired and accepted as any other the mo≈øt choi≈øe≈øt, and the rather, for that the mo≈øt part of the≈øe Out-landi≈øh flowers, do ≈øhew forth their beauty and colours ≈øo early in the yeare, that they ≈øeeme to make a Garden of delight euen in the Winter time, and doe ≈øo giue their flowers one after another, that all their brauery is not fully ≈øpent, vntil that Gilliflowers, the pride of our Engli≈øh Gardens, do ≈øhew them≈øelues: So that who≈øoeuer would haue of euery ≈øort of the≈øe flowers, may haue for euery moneth ≈øeuerall colours and varieties, euen from Chri≈øtmas vntill Mid≈øommer, or after; and then, after ≈øome little re≈øpite, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Chri≈øtmas againe, and that in ≈øome plenty, with great content and without forcing; ≈øo that euery man may haue them in euery place, if they will take any care of them. And becau≈øe there bee many Gentlewomen and others, that would gladly haue ≈øome fine flowers to furni≈øh their Gardens, but know not what the names of tho≈øe things are that they de≈øire, nor what are the times of their flowring, nor the skill and knowledge of their right ordering, planting, di≈øplanting, tran≈øplanting, and replanting; I haue here for their ≈øakes ≈øet downe the nature, names, times, and manner of ordering in a briefe manner, referring the more ample declaration of them to the worke following. And fir≈øt of their names and natures: Of Daffodils there are almo≈øt an hundred ≈øorts, as they are ≈øeuerally de≈øcribed hereafter, euery one to be di≈øtingui≈øhed from other, both in their times, formes, and colours, ≈øome being eyther white, or yellow, or mixt, or el≈øe being ≈ømall or great, ≈øingle or double, and ≈øome hauing but one flower vpon a ≈øtalke, others many, whereof many are ≈øo exceeding ≈øweete, that a very few are ≈øufficient to perfume a whole chamber, and be≈øides, many of them be ≈øo faire and double, eyther one vpon a ≈øtalke, or many vpon a ≈øtalke, that one or two ≈øtalkes of flowers are in ≈øtead of a whole no≈øe-gay, or bundell of flowers tyed together. This I doe affirme vpon good knowledge and certaine experience, and not as a great many others doe, tell of the wonders of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, which them≈øelues neuer ≈øaw nor euer heard of, except ≈øome ≈øuperficiall relation, which them≈øelues haue augmented according to their owne fan≈øie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Againe, let me here al≈øo by the way tell you, that many idle and ignorant Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and others, who get names by ≈øtealth, as they doe many other things, doe call <pb n="9" facs="tcp:15790:11"/> ≈øome of the≈øe Daffodils Narci≈ø≈øes, when as all know that know any Latine, that Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈ø≈øus is the Latine name, and Daffodill the Engli≈øh of one and the ≈øame thing; and therefore alone without any other Epithite cannot properly di≈øtingui≈øh ≈øeuerall things. I would willingly therefore that all would grow iudicious, and call euery thing by his proper Engli≈øh name in ≈øpeaking Engli≈øh, or el≈øe by ≈øuch Latine name as euery thing hath that hath not a proper Engli≈øh name, that thereby they may di≈øtingui≈øh the ≈øeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall varieties of things and not confound them, as al≈øo to take away all excu≈øes of mi≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; as for example: The ≈øingle Engli≈øh ba≈øtard Daffodill (which groweth wilde in many Woods, Groues, and Orchards in England.) The double Engli≈øh ba≈øtard Daffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dill. The French ≈øingle white Daffodill many vpon a ≈øtalke. The French double yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Daffodill. The great, or the little, or the lea≈øt Spani≈øh yellow ba≈øtard Daffodill, or the great or little Spani≈øh white Daffodill. The Turkie ≈øingle white Daffodill, or, The Turkie ≈øingle or double white Daffodill many vpon a ≈øtalke, &amp;c. Of Fritillaria, or the checkerd Daffodill, there are halfe a ≈øcore ≈øeuerall ≈øorts, both white and red, both yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and blacke, which are a wonderfull grace and ornament to a Garden in regard of the Checker like ≈øpots are in the flowers. Of Iacinthes there are aboue halfe an hundred ≈øorts, as they are ≈øpecified hereafter; ≈øome like vnto little bells or ≈øtarres, others like vnto little bottles or pearles, both white and blew, sky-coloured and blu≈øh, and ≈øome ≈øtarlike of many pretty various formes, and all to giue delight to them that will be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to ob≈øerue them. Of Crocus or Saffron flowers, there are al≈øo twenty ≈øorts; ≈øome of the Spring time, others flowring onely in the Autume or Fall, earlier or later than another, ≈øome whereof abide but a while, others indure aboue a moneth in their glorious beauty. The Colchicum or Medowe Saffron, which ≈øome call the ≈øonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the father, but not properly, is of many ≈øorts al≈øo; ≈øome flowring in the Spring of the yeare, but the mo≈øt in Autume, whereof ≈øome haue faire double flowers very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to behold, and ≈øome party coloured both ≈øingle and double ≈øo variable, that it would make any one admire the worke of the Creatour in the various ≈øpots and ≈øtripes of the≈øe flowers. Then haue wee of Lillies twenty ≈øeuerall ≈øorts and colours, among whom I mu≈øt reckon the Crowne Imperiall, that for his ≈øtately forme de≈øerueth ≈øome ≈øpeciall place in this Garden, as al≈øo the Martagons, both white and red, both blu≈øh and yellow, that require to be ≈øet by them≈øelues apart, as it were in a ≈ømall round or ≈øquare of a knot, without many other, or tall flowers growing neare them. But to tell you of all the ≈øorts of Tulipas (which are the pride of delight) they are ≈øo many, and as I may ≈øay, almo≈øt infinite, doth both pa≈ø≈øe my ability, and as I beleeue the skill of any other. They are of two e≈øpeciall ≈øorts, ≈øome flowring earlier, and others later than their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and that naturally in all grounds, wherein there is ≈øuch a wonderfull variety and mixture of colours, that it is almo≈øt impo≈ø≈øible for the wit of man to de≈øcipher them thoroughly, and to giue names that may be true &amp; ≈øeuerall di≈øtinctions to euery flower, three≈øcore ≈øeuerall ≈øorts of colours ≈øimple and mixed of each kind I can reckon vp that I haue, and of e≈øpeciall note, and yet I doubt not, but for euery one of them there are ten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers differing from them, which may be ≈øeen at ≈øeuerall times, and in ≈øeuerall places: &amp; be≈øides this glory of variety in colors that the≈øe flowers haue, they carry ≈øo ≈øtately &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull a forme, &amp; do abide ≈øo long in their brauery (enduring aboue three whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths from the fir≈øt vnto the la≈øt) that there is no Lady or Gentlewoman of any worth that is not caught with this delight, or not delighted with the≈øe flowers. The Anemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes likewi≈øe or Windeflowers are ≈øo full of variety and ≈øo dainty, ≈øo plea≈øant and ≈øo delight≈øome flowers, that the ≈øight of them doth enforce an earne≈øt longing de≈øire in the minde of any one to be a po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øour of ≈øome of them at the lea≈øt: For without all doubt, this one kinde of flower, ≈øo variable in colours, ≈øo differing in forme (being almo≈øt as many ≈øorts of them double as ≈øingle) ≈øo plentifull in bearing flowers, and ≈øo durable in la≈øting, and al≈øo ≈øo ea≈øie both to pre≈øerue and to encrea≈øe, is of it ≈øelfe alone almo≈øt ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to furni≈øh a garden with their flowers for almo≈øt halfe the yeare, as I ≈øhall ≈øhew you in a fit and conuenient place. The Beares eares or French Cow≈ølips mu≈øt not want their de≈øerued commendations, ≈øeeing that their flowers, being many ≈øet together vpon a ≈øtalke, doe ≈øeeme euery one of them to bee a No≈øegay alone of it ≈øelfe: and be≈øides the many differing colours that are to be ≈øeene in them, as white, yellow, blu≈øh, purple, red, tawney, murrey, haire colour, &amp;c. which encrea≈øe much delight in all ≈øorts of the Gentry of the Land, they are not vnfurni≈øhed with a pretty ≈øweete ≈øent, <pb n="10" facs="tcp:15790:12"/> which doth adde an encrea≈øe of plea≈øure in tho≈øe that make them an ornament for their wearing. Flowerdeluces al≈øo are of many ≈øorts, but diuided into two e≈øpeciall kindes; the one bearing a leafe like a flagge, who≈øe rootes are tuberous, thicke and ≈øhort (one kinde of them being the Orris rootes that are ≈øold at the Apothecaries, whereof ≈øweete powders are made to lye among garments) the other hauing round rootes like vnto Onions, and narrow long leaues ≈øomewhat like gra≈ø≈øe: Of both the≈øe kindes there is much variety, e≈øpecially in their colours. The greater Flagge kinde is frequent enough and di≈øper≈øed in this Land, and well doth ≈øerue to decke vp both a Garden and Hou≈øe with natures beauties: But the chiefe of all is your Sable flower, ≈øo fit for a mourning habit, that I thinke in the whole compa≈ø≈øe of natures ≈øtore, there is not a more patheticall, or of greater corre≈øpondency, nor yet among all the flowers I know any one comming neare vnto the colour of it. The other kinde which hath bulbous or Onion like rootes, diuer≈øifieth it ≈øelfe al≈øo into ≈øo many fine colours, being of a more neate ≈øhape and ≈øuccinct forme than the former, that it mu≈øt not bee wanting to furni≈øh this Garden. The Hepatica or Noble Liuerwoort is another flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of account, whereof ≈øome are white, others red, or blew, or purple, ≈øomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembling Violets, but that there are white threads in the midde≈øt of their flowers, which adde the more grace vnto them; and one kinde of them is ≈øo double, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembleth a double thicke Da≈øie or Marigold, but being ≈ømall and of an excellent blew colour, is like vnto a Button: but that which commendeth the flower as much as the beauty, is the earline≈ø≈øe in flowring, for that it is one of the very fir≈øt flowers that open them≈øelues after Chri≈øtmas, euen in the mid≈øt of Winter. The Cyclamen or Sowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread is a flower of rare receipt, becau≈øe it is naturally hard to encrea≈øe, and that the flowers are like vnto red or blu≈øh coloured Violets, flowring in the end of Summer or beginning of Autumne: the leaues likewi≈øe hereof haue no ≈ømall delight in their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant colour, being ≈øpotted and circled white vpon greene, and that which mo≈øt prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, is the Phy≈øicall properties thereof for women, which I will declare when I ≈øhall ≈øhew you the ≈øeuerall de≈øcriptions of the varieties in his proper place. Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øorts of flowers there are fit to furni≈øh this Garden, as Leucoium or Bulbous Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, both early and late flowring. Mu≈øcari or Muske Grape flower. Starre flowers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ≈øorts. Phalangium or Spiderwort, the chiefe of many is that ≈øort who≈øe flowers are like vnto a white Lilly. Winter Crowfoote or Wolfes bane. The Chri≈øtmas flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er like vnto a ≈øingle white Ro≈øe. Bell flowers of many kindes. Yellow Larkes ≈øpurre, the prettie≈øt flower of a ≈øcore in a Garden. Flower-gentle or Floramour. Flower of the Sunne. The Maruaile of Peru or of the world. Double Mar≈øh Marigold or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yellow Buttons, much differing and farre exceeding your double yellow Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote, which ≈øome call Batchelours Buttons. Double French Marigolds that ≈ømell well, and is a greater kinde than the ordinary, and farre ≈øurpa≈ø≈øeth it. The double red Ranunculus or Crowfoote (farre excelling the mo≈øt glorious double Anemone) and is like vnto our great yellow double Crowfoote. Thus hauing giuen you the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ≈øome of the choi≈øe≈øt flowers for the beds of this Garden, let me al≈øo ≈øhew you what are fitte≈øt for your borders, and for your arbours. The Ia≈ømine white and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The double Hony≈øockle. The Ladies Bower, both white, and red, and purple ≈øingle and double, are the fitte≈øt of Outlandi≈øh plants to ≈øet by arbours and banqueting hou≈øes, that are open, both before and aboue to helpe to couer them, and to giue both ≈øight, ≈ømell, and delight. The ≈øorts of Ro≈øes are fitte≈øt for ≈øtandards in the hedges or borders. The Cherry Bay or Laurocera≈øus. The Ro≈øe Bay or Oleander. The white and the blew Syringa or Pipe tree, are all gracefull and delightfull to ≈øet at ≈øeuerall di≈øtances in the borders of knots; for ≈øome of them giue beautifull and ≈øweete flowers. The Pyracantha or Prickly Corall tree doth remaine with greene leaues all the yeare, and may be pla≈øhed, or laid downe, or tyed to make a fine hedge to border the whole knot, as is ≈øaid before. The Wilde Bay or Laurus Tinus, doth chiefly de≈øire to be ≈øhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered vnder a wall, where it will be≈øt thriue, and giue you his beautifull flowers in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for your delight, in recompence of his fenced dwelling. The Dwarfe Bay or Me≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reon, is mo≈øt commonly either placed in the mid≈øt of a knot, or at the corners thereof, and ≈øometimes all along a walke for the more grace. And thus to fit euery ones fancy, I haue ≈øhewed you the variety of natures ≈øtore in ≈øome part for you to di≈øpo≈øe of them to your be≈øt content.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The nature and names of tho≈øe that are called v≈øually Engli≈øh flowers.</head>
               <p>THo≈øe flowers that haue beene v≈øually planted in former times in Gardens of this Kingdome (when as our forefathers knew few or none of tho≈øe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited before) haue by time and cu≈øtome attained the name of Engli≈øh flowers, although the mo≈øt of them were neuer naturall of this our Land, but brought in from other Countries at one time or other, by tho≈øe that tooke plea≈øure in them where they fir≈øt ≈øaw them: and I doubt not, but many other ≈øorts than here are ≈øet downe, or now knowne to vs, haue beene brought, which either haue peri≈øhed by their negligence or want of skill that brought them, or el≈øe becau≈øe they could not abide our cold Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; tho≈øe onely remaining with vs that haue endured of them≈øelues, and by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øing haue beene di≈øtributed ouer the whole Land. If I ≈øhould make any large di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe of them, being ≈øo well knowne to all, I doubt I ≈øhould make a long tale to ≈ømall purpo≈øe: I will therefore but briefly recite them, that you may haue them together in one place, with ≈øome little declaration of the nature and quality of them, and ≈øo pa≈ø≈øe to other matters. And fir≈øt of Primro≈øes and Cow≈ølips, whereof there are many pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie varieties; ≈øome better knowne in the We≈øt parts of this Kingdome, others in the North, than in any other, vntill of late being ob≈øerued by ≈øome curious louers of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, they haue been tran≈øplanted diuer≈øly, and ≈øo made more common: for although we haue had formerly in the≈øe parts about London greene Primro≈øes v≈øually, yet we neuer ≈øaw or heard of greene Cow≈ølips both ≈øingle and double but of late dayes, and ≈øo likewi≈øe for Primro≈øes to be both ≈øingle and double from one roote, and diuers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ≈øtalke of diuers fa≈øhions, I am ≈øure is not v≈øuall: all which de≈øire rather to bee planted vnder ≈øome hedge, or fence, or in the ≈øhade, than in the Sunne. Single Ro≈øe Campions, both white, red, and blu≈øh, and the double red Ro≈øe Campion al≈øo is knowne ≈øufficiently, and will abide moderate Sunne as well as the ≈øhade. The flower of Bri≈øtow or None-≈øuch is likewi≈øe another kinde of Campion, whereof there is both white flowring plants and blu≈øh as well as Orange colour, all of them being ≈øingle flowers require a moderate Sunne and not the ≈øhadow: But the Orange colour None-≈øuch with double flowers, as it is rare and not common, ≈øo for his brauery doth well de≈øerue a Ma≈øter of account that will take care to keepe and pre≈øerue it. Batchelours Buttons both white and red, are kindes of wilde Campions of a very double forme, and will rea≈øonably well like the Sunne but not the ≈øhade. Wall-flowers are common in euery Garden, as well the ordinary double as the ≈øingle, and the double kinde de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no more ≈øhade than the ≈øingle, but the greater kindes both double and ≈øingle mu≈øt haue the Sunne. Stock-Gilloflowers likewi≈øe are almo≈øt as common as Wall-flowers, e≈øpecially the ≈øingle kindes in euery womans Garden, but the double kindes are much more rare, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed but of a few, and tho≈øe onely that will bee carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue them in Winter; for be≈øides that the mo≈øt of them are more tender, they yeeld no ≈øeede as the ≈øingle kindes doe to pre≈øerue them, although one kinde from the ≈øow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ≈øeed yeeld double flowers: They will all require the comfort of the Sunne, e≈øpecially the double kindes, and to be defended from cold, yet ≈øo as in the Summer they doe not want water wherein they much ioy, and which is as it were their life. Queenes Gilloflowers (which ≈øome call Dames Violets, and ≈øome Winter Gilloflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are a kinde of Stock-Gilloflower) planted in Gardens to ≈øerue to fill vp the parts thereof for want of better things, hauing in mine opinion neither ≈øight nor ≈øent much to commend them. Violets are the Springs chiefe flowers for beauty, ≈ømell, and v≈øe, both ≈øingle and double, the more ≈øhadie and moi≈øt they ≈øtand the better. Snapdragon are flowers of much more delight, and in that they are more tender to keep, and will hardly endure the ≈øharpe Winters, vnle≈ø≈øe they ≈øtand well defended, are ≈øcarce ≈øeene in many Gardens. Columbines ≈øingle and double, of many ≈øorts, fa≈øhions, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, very variable both ≈øpeckled and party coloured, are flowers of that re≈øpect, as that no Garden would willingly bee without them, that could tell how to haue them, yet the rarer the flowers are, the more trouble to keepe; the ordinary ≈øorts on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <pb n="12" facs="tcp:15790:13"/> part will not be lo≈øt, doe what one will. Larkes heeles, or ≈øpurres, or toes, as in ≈øeuerall Countries they are called, exceed in the varietie of colours, both ≈øingle and double, any of the former times; for vntill of late dayes none of the mo≈øt plea≈øant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours were ≈øeene or heard of: but now the ≈øingle kindes are rea≈øonable well di≈øper≈øt ouer the Land, yet the double kindes of all tho≈øe plea≈øant colours (and ≈øome other al≈øo as beautifull) which ≈øtand like little double Ro≈øes, are enioyed but of a few: all of them ri≈øe from ≈øeed, and mu≈øt be ≈øowne euery yeare, the double as well as the ≈øingle. Pan≈øyes or Hartes ea≈øes of diuers colours, and although without ≈øent, yet not without ≈øome re≈øpect and delight. Double Poppies are flowers of a great and goodly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adorning a Garden with their variable colours to the delight of the beholders, wherein there is ≈øome ≈øpeciall care to be taken, le≈øt they turne ≈øingle; and that is, if you ≈øee them grow vp too thicke, that you mu≈øt pull them vp, and not ≈øuffer them to grow within le≈ø≈øe than halfe a yard di≈øtance, or more one from another. Double Dai≈øies are flowers not to be forgotten, although they be common enough in euery Garden, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both white and red, both blu≈øh and ≈øpeckled, or party coloured, be≈øides that which is called Iacke an Apes on hor≈øebacke, they require a moi≈øt and ≈øhadowie place; for they are ≈øcorched away, if they ≈øtand in the Sunne in any dry place. Double Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigolds al≈øo are the mo≈øt common in all Gardens. And ≈øo are the French Marigolds that haue a ≈øtrong heady ≈øent, both ≈øingle and double, who≈øe glorious ≈øhew for colour would cau≈øe any to beleeue there were ≈øome rare goodne≈ø≈øe or vertue in them. The≈øe all are ≈øometimes pre≈øerued in the Winter, if they bee well defended from the cold. But what ≈øhall I ≈øay to the Queene of delight and of flowers, Carnations and Gillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, who≈øe brauery, variety, and ≈øweete ≈ømell ioyned together, tyeth euery ones affection with great earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe, both to like and to haue them? Tho≈øe that were knowne, and enioyed in former times with much acceptation, are now for the mo≈øt part le≈ø≈øe accounted of, except a very few: for now there are ≈øo many other varieties of later inuention, that troubleth the other both in number, beauty, and worth: The names of them doe differ very variably, in that names are impo≈øed and altered as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ones fancy will haue them, that carryed or ≈øent them into the ≈øeuerall Countries from London, where their true≈øt name is to be had, in mine opinion. I will here but giue you the names of ≈øome, and referre you to the worke en≈øuing for your further knowledge. The red and the gray Hulo. The old Carnation, differing from them both. The Gran Pere. The Camber≈øiue. The Sauadge. The Chri≈øtall. The Prince. The white Carnation, or Delicate. The ground Carnation. The French Carnation. The Douer. The Oxford. The Bri≈øtow. The We≈øtmin≈øter. The Daintie. The Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado, and many other Gilloflowers too tedious to recite in this place, becau≈øe I haue amply declared them in the booke following. But there is another ≈øort of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and varietie, called the Orange tawny Gilloflower, which for the mo≈øt part hath ri≈øen from ≈øeed, and doth giue ≈øeed in a more plentifull manner than any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ≈øorts, and likewi≈øe by the ≈øowing of the ≈øeed there hath been gained ≈øo many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of that excellent worth and re≈øpect, that it can hardly be expre≈ø≈øed or beleeued, and called by diuers names according to the marking of the flowers; as The Infanta. The Stript Tawny. The Speckled Tawny. The Flackt Tawny. The Gri≈øeld Tawny, and many others, euery one to bee di≈øtingui≈øhed from others: Some al≈øo haue their flowers more double and large than others, and ≈øome from the ≈øame ≈øeed haue ≈øingle flowers like broad ≈øingle Pinkes: the further relation of them, <hi>viz.</hi> their order to ≈øowe, encrea≈øe, and pre≈øerue them, you ≈øhall haue in the ≈øub≈øequent di≈øcour≈øe in a place by it ≈øelfe. Pinkes likewi≈øe both ≈øingle and double are of much variety, all of them very ≈øweete, comming neare the Gilloflowers. Sweete Williams and Sweete Iohns, both ≈øingle and double, both white, red, and ≈øpotted, as they are kindes of wilde Pinkes, ≈øo for their grace and beauty helpe to furni≈øh a Garden, yet de≈øire not to ≈øtand ≈øo open to the Sunne as the former. Double and ≈øingle Peonies are fit flowers to furni≈øh a Garden, and by rea≈øon of their durability, giue out fre≈øh plea≈øure euery yeare without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble of ≈øowing. And la≈øtly, Hollihocks both ≈øingle and double, of many and ≈øundry colours, yeeld out their flowers like Ro≈øes on their tall branches, like Trees, to ≈øute you with flowers, when almo≈øt you haue no other to grace out your Garden: the ≈øingle and double doe both yeeld ≈øeed, and yet doe after their ≈øeeding abide many yeares. Thus haue I ≈øhewed you mo≈øt of the Engli≈øh, as well as (I did before) the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landi≈øh <pb n="13" facs="tcp:15790:13"/> flowers, that are fit to furni≈øh the knots, trailes, beds, and borders of this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The order and manner to plant and replant all the ≈øorts of Out-landi≈øh flowers ≈øpoken of before, as well tho≈øe with bulbous rootes, as others with ≈øtringie rootes.</head>
               <p>WHereas it is the v≈øuall cu≈øtome of mo≈øt in this Land, to turne vp their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and to plant them againe in the Spring of the yeare, which is the be≈øt time that may bee cho≈øen for all Engli≈øh flowers, yet it is not ≈øo for your Out-landi≈øh flowers. And herein indeede hath beene not onely the errour of a great many to hinder their rootes from bearing out their flowers as they ≈øhould, but al≈øo to hinder many to take delight in them, becau≈øe as they ≈øay they will not thriue and pro≈øper with them, when as the whole fault is in the want of knowledge of the fit and conuenient time wherein they ≈øhould bee planted. And becau≈øe our Engli≈øh Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners are all or the mo≈øt of them vtterly ignorant in the ordering of the≈øe Out-landi≈øh flowers, as not being trained vp to know them, I haue here taken vpon mee the forme of a new Gardiner, to giue in≈øtructions to tho≈øe that will take plea≈øure in them, that they may be the better enabled with the≈øe helpes I ≈øhall ≈øhew them, both to know how they ≈øhould be ordered, and to direct their Gardiners <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>hat are ignorant thereof, rightly to di≈øpo≈øe them according to their naturall qualities. And I doe wi≈øhall Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, whom it may concerne for their owne good, to bee as carefull whom they tru≈øt with the planting and replanting of the≈øe fine flowers, as they would be with ≈øo many Iewels; for the rootes of many of them being ≈ømall, and of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, may be ≈øoone conueyed away, and a cleanly tale faire told, that ≈øuch a roote is rotten, or peri≈øhed in the ground if none be ≈øeene where it ≈øhould be, or el≈øe that the flower hath changed his colour, when it hath been taken away, or a counterfeit one hath beene put in the place thereof; and thus many haue been deceiued of their dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie≈øt flowers, without remedy or true knowledge of the defect. You ≈øhall therefore, if you will take the right cour≈øe that is proper for the≈øe kindes of flowers, not ≈øet or plant them among your Engli≈øh flowers; for that when the one may be remoued, the other may not be ≈øtirred: but plant tho≈øe rootes that are bulbous, or round like Onions, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in knots or beds by them≈øelues which is the be≈øt, or with but very few Engli≈øh or Out-landi≈øh flower plants that haue ≈øtringie rootes: For you mu≈øt take this for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule, that all tho≈øe rootes that are like Lillies or Onions, are to bee planted in the moneths of Iuly or Augu≈øt, or vnto the middle or end of September at the furthe≈øt, if you will haue them to pro≈øper as they ≈øhould; and not in the Spring of the yeare, when other gardening is v≈øed. Yet I mu≈øt likewi≈øe giue you to vnder≈øtand, that if Tulipas, and Daffodils, and ≈øome other that are firme and hard rootes, and not limber or ≈øpongie, being taken vp out of the ground in their fit ≈øea≈øon, that is, in Iune, Iuly, and Augu≈øt, and likewi≈øe kept well and dry, may bee re≈øerued out of the ground vntill Chri≈øtmas or after, and then (if they could not be ≈øet ≈øooner) being ≈øet, will thriue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable well, but not altogether ≈øo well as the former, being ≈øet long before: but if you ≈øhall remoue the≈øe bulbous rootes againe, either pre≈øently after their planting ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ≈øhot their ≈ømall fibres vnder the round rootes, and ≈øprung likewi≈øe vpwards, or before they be in flower at the ≈øoone≈øt (yet Tulipas, Daffodils, and many other bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous, may be ≈øafely remoued being in flower, and tran≈øplanted into other places, ≈øo as they be not kept too long out of the ground) you ≈øhall much endanger them either vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to peri≈øh, or to be hindered from bearing out their flowers they then would haue
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15790:14"/> borne, and for two or three years after from bearing flowers againe. For the order of their planting there are diuers wayes, ≈øome whereof I will ≈øhew you in this place: Your knot or beds being prepared fitly, as before is declared, you may place and order your rootes therein thus, Eyther many rootes of one kind ≈øet together in a round or clu≈øter, or longwi≈øe cro≈ø≈øe a bed one by another, whereby the beauty of many flowers of one kinde being together, may make a faire ≈øhew well plea≈øing to many; Or el≈øe you may plant one or two in a place di≈øper≈øedly ouer the whole knot, or in a proportion or dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter one place an≈øwering another of the knot, as your ≈øtore will ≈øuffer you, or your knot permit: Or you may al≈øo mingle the≈øe rootes in their planting many of diuers ≈øorts together, that they may giue the more glorious ≈øhew when they are in flower; and that you may ≈øo doe, you mu≈øt fir≈øt ob≈øerue the ≈øeuerall kindes of them, which doe flower at one and the ≈øame time, and then to place them in ≈øuch order and ≈øo neare one vnto another, that their flowers appearing together of ≈øeuerall colours, will cau≈øe the more admiration in the beholders: as thus, The Vernall Crocus or Saffron flowers of the Spring, white, purple, yellow, and ≈øtript, with ≈øome Vernall Colchicum or Medow Saffron among them, ≈øome Deus Caninus or Dogges teeth, and ≈øome of the ≈ømall early Leucoium or Bulbous Violet, all planted in ≈øome proportion as neare one vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as is fit for them, will giue ≈øuch a grace to the Garden, that the place will ≈øeeme like a peece of tape≈øtry of many glorious colours, to encrea≈øe euery ones delight: Or el≈øe many of one ≈øort together, as the blew, white and blu≈øh Grape flowers in the ≈øame manner intermingled, doe make a maruellous delectable ≈øhew, e≈øpecially becau≈øe all of them ri≈øe almo≈øt to an equall height, which cau≈øeth the greater grace, as well neare hand as farre of. The like order may be kept with many other things, as the Hepatica, white, blew, purple, and red ≈øet or ≈øowne together, will make many to beleeue that one roote doth beare all tho≈øe colours: But aboue and beyond all others, the Tulipas may be ≈øo matched, one colour an≈øwering and ≈øetting of another, that the place where they ≈øtand may re≈øemble a peece of curious needle-worke, or peece of painting: and I haue knowne in a Garden, the Ma≈øter as much commended for this artificiall forme in placing the colours of Tulipas, as for the goodne≈ø≈øe of his flowers, or any other thing. The diuers ≈øorts and colours of Anemones or Winde-flowers may be ≈øo ordered like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, which are very beautifull, to haue the ≈øeuerall varieties planted one neare vnto another, that their ≈øeuerall colours appearing in one place will be a very great grace in a Garden, or if they be di≈øper≈øed among the other ≈øorts of flowers, they will make a glorious ≈øhew. Another order in planting you may ob≈øerue; which is this, That tho≈øe plants that grow low, as the Aconitum Hyemale or Winter-wolues bane, the Vernall Crocus or Saffron-flowers of diuers ≈øorts, the little early Leucoium or Bulbous Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and ≈øome ≈øuch other as ri≈øe not vp high, as al≈øo ≈øome Anemones may be very well placed ≈øomewhat neare or about your Martagons, Lillies, or Crownes Imperiall, both becau≈øe the≈øe little plants will flower earlier than they, and ≈øo will bee gone and pa≈øt, before the other greater plants will ri≈øe vp to any height to hinder them; which is a way may well be admitted in tho≈øe Gardens that are ≈ømall, to ≈øaue roome, and to place things to the mo≈øt aduantage. Thus hauing ≈øhewed you diuers wayes and orders how to plant your rootes, that your flowers may giue the greater grace in the Garden, let mee ≈øhew you likewi≈øe how to ≈øet the≈øe kindes of rootes into the ground; for many know not well eyther which end to ≈øet vpwards or downewards, nor yet to what depth they ≈øhould be placed in the ground. Daffodils if they be great rootes, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire (as mu≈øt bee ob≈øerued in all other great plants) to bee planted ≈øomewhat deeper then the ≈ømaller of the ≈øame kinde, as al≈øo that the tops or heads of the rootes be about two or three fingers breadth hid vnderground. The Tulipas likewi≈øe if you ≈øet them deepe, they will be the ≈øafer from fro≈øts if your ground be cold, which will al≈øo cau≈øe them to be a little later before they be in flower, yet v≈øually if the mould be good, they are to be ≈øet a good hand breadth deep within the ground, ≈øo that there may be three or foure inches of earth at the lea≈øt aboue the head, which is the ≈ømaller end of the roote: for if they ≈øhall lye too neare the vpper face or cru≈øt of the earth, the colds &amp; fro≈øts will pierce and pinch them the ≈øooner. After the ≈øame order and manner mu≈øt Hyacinthes, whether great or ≈ømall, and other ≈øuch great rootes be planted. Your greater rootes, as Martagons, Lillies, and Crownes Imperiall, mu≈øt be ≈øet much deeper then any other bulbous roote, becau≈øe they are greater rootes then others, and by them≈øelues al≈øo, as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15790:14"/> is mo≈øt v≈øuall either in ≈øome ≈øquare, round, triangle, or other ≈ømall part in the Garden, becau≈øe they ≈øpread and take vp a very great deale of ground. All of them likewi≈øe are to be ≈øet with the broad end of the roote downewards, and the ≈ømall end vpwards, that is, both Lillies, Daffodils, Hyacinthes, and Tulipas, and all other ≈øorts of round rootes, which ≈øhew one end to bee ≈ømaller than another. But the Colchicum or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-Saffron onely requireth an exception to this generall rule, in regard the roote thereof hath a ≈ømall eminence or part on the one ≈øide thereof, which mu≈øt bee ≈øet or planted downeward, and not vpward; for you ≈øhall ob≈øerue, if the roote lye a little moi≈øt out of the ground, that it will ≈øhoote fibres out at the ≈ømall long end thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you may perceiue when you take it vp, that the fibres were at the other broad end or ≈øide of the roote. As for the Crowne Imperiall, which is a broad round roote and flat withall, hauing a hole in the middle, for the mo≈øt part quite thorow, when it is taken vp in his due time out of the ground, you ≈øhall perceiue the ≈øcales or cloues of the rootes to bee a little open on the vpper≈øide, and clo≈øe and flat on the vnder≈øide, which will direct you which part to ≈øet vpward, as al≈øo that the hole is bigger aboue then it is below. The Per≈øian Lilly is almo≈øt like vnto the Crowne Imperiall, but that the roote thereof is not ≈øo flat, and that it hath a ≈ømaller head at the one part, whereby it may be di≈øcerned the plainer how to be ≈øet. The Fritillaria is a ≈ømall white root di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided as it were into two parts, ≈øo that many haue doubted, as formerly in the Crowne Imperiall, what part to ≈øet vppermo≈øt; you ≈øhall therefore marke, that the two parts of the roote are ioyned together at the bottome, where it ≈øhooteth out fibres or ≈ømall ≈øtringie rootes, as all other ≈øorts of bulbous rootes doe, and withall you ≈øhall ≈øee, that betweene the two parts of the roote a ≈ømall head will appeare, which is the burgeon that will ≈øpring vp to beare leaues and flowers. In the rootes of Anemones there are ≈ømall round ≈øwelling heads, ea≈øie enough to be ob≈øerued if you marke it, which mu≈øt be ≈øet vpwards. All other ≈øorts of ≈øtringie rooted plants (and not bulbous or tuberous rooted) that lo≈øe their greene leaues in Winter, will ≈øhew a head from whence the leaues and flowers will ≈øpring, and all others that keepe their greene leaues, are to bee planted in the ≈øame manner that other herbes and flower-plants are accu≈øtomed to be. But yet for the better thriuing of the ≈øtringie rooted plants, when you will plant them, let me informe you of the be≈øt way of planting, and the mo≈øt ≈øure to cau≈øe any plant to comprehend in the ground without failing, and is no common way with any Gardiner in this Kingdome, that euer I heard or knew, which is thus: Pre≈øuming that the ≈øtringie rooted plant is fre≈øh and not old gathered, and a plant that being remoued will grow againe, make a hole in the ground large enough where you meane to ≈øet this roote, and rai≈øe the earth within the hole a little higher in the middle then on the ≈øides, and ≈øet the roote thereon, ≈øpreading the ≈øtrings all abroad about the middle, that they may as it were couer the middle, and then put the earth gently round about it, pre≈ø≈øing it a little clo≈øe, and afterwards water it well, if it be in Summer, or in a dry time, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe moderately: thus ≈øhall euery ≈øeuerall ≈øtring of the roote haue earth enough to cau≈øe it to ≈øhoote forth, and thereby to encrea≈øe farre better than by the v≈øuall way, which is without any great care and re≈øpect to thru≈øt the rootes together into the ground. Diuers other flower plants are but annuall, to bee new ≈øowne euery yeare; as the Maruaile of the world, the Indian Cre≈ø≈øes, or yellow Larkes heeles, the Flower of the Sunne, and diuers other: they therefore that will take plea≈øure in them, that they may enioy their flowers the earlier in the yeare, and thereby haue ripe ≈øeede of them while warme weather la≈øteth, mu≈øt nur≈øe vp their ≈øeedes in a bed of hot dung, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons and Cowcumbers are, but your bed mu≈øt be prouided earlier for the≈øe ≈øeeds, than for Melons, &amp;c. that they may haue the more comfort of the Summer, which are to be carefully tended after they are tran≈øplanted from the hot bed, and couered with ≈øtraw from colds, whereby you ≈øhall not faile to gaine ripe ≈øeed euery yeare, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe if you ≈øhould mi≈ø≈øe of a very kindly &amp; hot Summer, you ≈øhould neuer haue. Some of the≈øe ≈øeedes neede likewi≈øe to be tran≈øplanted from the bed of dung vnder a warme wall, as the Flower of the Sunne, and the Maruaile of the world, and ≈øome others, and that for a while after their tran≈øplanting, as al≈øo in the heate of Summer, you water them at the roote with water that hath ≈øtood a day or two in the Sunne, hauing fir≈øt laid a round wi≈øpe of hay or ≈øuch other thing round about the roote, that ≈øo all helpes may further their giuing of ripe ≈øeede. One or two rules more I will giue you concerning
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15790:15"/> the≈øe dainty flowers, the fir≈øt whereof is this, That you ≈øhall not bee carefull to water any of your bulbous or tuberous rooted plants at any time; for they all of them do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pro≈øper in a dry ground than in a wet, onely all ≈øorts of tuberous rooted Flower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luces vpon their remouall had neede of a little water, and ≈øome will doe ≈øo al≈øo to ≈øuch Tulipas and other bulbous rootes as they tran≈øplant, when they are in flower, and this is I grant in ≈øome ≈øort tolerable, if it bee not too much, and done onely to cau≈øe the ≈øtalke and flower to abide ≈øometime the longer before they wither, but el≈øe in no other ca≈øe to be permitted. The ≈øecond rule is, That I would adui≈øe you to water none of your dainty flowers or herbes, with any water that hath pre≈øently before been drawne out of a well or pumpe, but onely with ≈øuch water that hath ≈øtood open in the Sunne in ≈øome ci≈øterne, tubbe, or pot for a day at the lea≈øt, if more the better: for that water which is pre≈øently drawne out of a well, &amp;c. is ≈øo cold, that it pre≈øently chilleth &amp; kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth any dainty plant be it younger or elder grown, wherof I haue had ≈øufficient proofe: and therfore I giue you this caution by mine own experience. Thus haue I directed you from point to point, in all the particulars of preparing &amp; planting that belong to this Garden, ≈øauing only that yet I would further enforme you, of the time of the flowring of the≈øe Out-landi≈øh plants, according to the ≈øeuerall moneths in the yeare, that euery one may know what flowers euery moneth yeeldeth, and may chu≈øe what them liketh be≈øt, in that they may ≈øee hat there is no moneth, but glorieth in ≈øome peculiar ≈øorts of rare flowers. I would likewi≈øe rather in this place ≈øhew you, the true and be≈øt manner &amp; order to encrea≈øe and pre≈øerue all ≈øorts of Gilloflowers &amp; Carnations, then ioyne it with the Chapter of Gilloflowers in the worke following, becau≈øe it would in that place take vp too much roome. And la≈øtly, I mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity oppo≈øe three ≈øundry errours, that haue po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed the mindes of many both in former and later times, which are, that any flower may be made to grow double by art, that was but ≈øingle before by nature: And that one may by art cau≈øe any flower to grow of what colour they will: And that any plants may be forced to flower out of their due ≈øea≈øons, either earlier or later, by an art which ≈øome can v≈øe. All which being declared. I then ≈øuppo≈øe enough is ≈øpoken for an introduction to this worke, referring many other things to the ≈øeuerall directions in the Chapters of the booke.</p>

I begin with Ianuary, as the fir≈øt moneth of the yeare, wherein if the fro≈øts be not extreme, you ≈øhall haue the≈øe flowers of plants; the Chri≈øtmas flower or Helleborus niger verus, Winter wolues bane or Aconitum hye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, Hepatica or Noble Liuer wort blew and red, and of ≈øhrubbes, the Laurus Tinus or Wilde Bay tree, and Me≈øereon or the dwarfe Bay: but becau≈øe Ianuarie is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too deepe in fro≈øts and ≈ønow, I therefore referre the Hepaticas vnto the moneth following, which is February, wherein the weather beginneth to be a little milder, and then they will flower much better, as al≈øo diuers ≈øorts of Crocus or Saffron flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will appeare, the little early Summer foole or Leucoium bulbo≈øum, and towards the latter end thereof the Vernall Colchicum, the Dogges tooth Violet or Deus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, and ≈øome Anemones, both ≈øingle and double, which in ≈øome places will flower all the Winter long. March will yeeld more varieties; for be≈øides that it holdeth ≈øome of the flowers of the former moneth, it will yeeld you both the double blew He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patica, and the white and the blu≈øh ≈øingle: then al≈øo you ≈øhall haue diuers other ≈øorts of Crocus or Saffron flowers, Double yellow Daffodils, Orientall Iacinths and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Crowne Imperiall, diuers ≈øorts of early Tulipas, ≈øome ≈øorts of French Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølips, both tawney, murry, yellow, and blu≈øh, the early Fritillaria or checkerd Daffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dill,

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The true manner and order to encrea≈øe and pre≈øerue all ≈øorts of Gilloflowers, as well by ≈ølippes as ≈øeedes.</head>
               <p>BEcau≈øe that Carnations and Gilloflowers bee the chiefe≈øt flowers of account in all our Engli≈øh Gardens, I haue thought good to entreate ≈øomewhat amply of them, and that a part by it ≈øelfe, as I ≈øaid a little before, in regard there is ≈øo much to be ≈øaid concerning them, and that if all the matters to be entreated of ≈øhould haue beene in≈øerted in the Chapter of Gilloflowers, it would haue made it too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and large, and taken vp too much roome. The particular matters whereof I mean in this place to entreate are the≈øe: How to encrea≈øe Gilloflowers by planting and by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15790:16"/> ≈øowing, and how to pre≈øerue them being encrea≈øed, both in Summer from noy≈øome and hurtfull vermine that de≈øtroy them, and in Winter from fro≈øts, ≈ønowes, and windes, that ≈øpoile them. There are two wayes of planting, whereby to encrea≈øe the≈øe faire flowers; the one is by ≈ølipping, which is the old and ready v≈øuall way, be≈øt knowne in this Kingdome; the other is more ≈øure, perfect, ready, and of later inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>videlicet,</hi> by laying downe the branches. The way to encrea≈øe Gilloflowers by ≈ølipping, is ≈øo common with all that euer kept any of them, that I thinke mo≈øt per≈øons may thinke meidle, to ≈øpend time to ≈øet downe in writing that which is ≈øo well known vnto all: Yet giue me leaue to tell them that ≈øo might imagine, that (when they haue heard or read what I haue written thereof, if they did know fully as much before) what I here write, was not to informe them, but ≈øuch as did not know the be≈øt, or ≈øo good a way as I teach them: For I am a≈ø≈øured, the greate≈øt number doe v≈øe, and follow the mo≈øt v≈øuall way, and that is not alwaies the be≈øt, e≈øpecially when by good experience a better way is found, and may be learned; and therefore if ≈øome can doe a thing better than others, I thinke it is no ≈øhame to learne it of them. You ≈øhall not then (to take the ≈øure≈øt cour≈øe) take any long ≈øpindled branches, nor tho≈øe branches that haue any young ≈øhootes from the ioynts on them, nor yet ≈øliue or teare any ≈ølippe or branch from the roote; for all the≈øe waies are v≈øuall and common with mo≈øt, which cau≈øeth ≈øo many good rootes to rot and peri≈øh, and al≈øo ≈øo many ≈ølippes to be lo≈øt, when as for the mo≈øt part, not the one halfe, or with ≈øome, not a third part doth grow and thriue of tho≈øe ≈ølippes they ≈øet. And although many that haue ≈øtore of plants, doe not ≈øo much care what hauocke they make to gaine ≈øome, yet to ≈øaue both labour and plants, I doe wi≈øh them to ob≈øerue the≈øe orders: Take from tho≈øe rootes from whence you intend to make your encrea≈øe, tho≈øe ≈øhootes onely that are rea≈øonable ≈øtrong, but yet young, and not either too ≈ømall and ≈ølender, or hauing any ≈øhootes from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the≈øe ≈ølippes are well growne vp, they mu≈øt be tran≈øplanted into ≈øuch other places as you thinke meete; that is, either into the ground in beds, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, or into pots, which that you may the more ≈øafely doe, after you haue well wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ground, for halfe a day before you intend to tran≈øplant them, you ≈øhall ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them ≈øeuerally, by putting down a broad pointed knife on each ≈øide of the ≈ølippe, ≈øo cutting it out, take euery one by it ≈øelfe, with the earth cleauing clo≈øe vnto the root, which by rea≈øon of the moi≈øture it had formerly, and that which you gaue pre≈øently before, will be ≈øufficient with any care had, to cau≈øe it to hold fa≈øt vnto the roote for the tran≈øplanting of it: for if the earth were dry, and that it ≈øhould fall away from the roote in the tran≈øplanting, it would hazzard and endanger the roote very much, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it did thriue at all. You mu≈øt remember al≈øo, that vpon the remouing of the≈øe ≈ølips, you ≈øhadow them from the heate of the Sunne for a while with ≈øome ≈øtraw or other thing, vntill they haue taken hold in their new place. Thus although it bee a little more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and care than the ordinary way is, yet it is ≈øurer, and will giue you plants that <pb n="19" facs="tcp:15790:16"/> will be ≈øo ≈øtrongly growne before Winter, that with the care hereafter ≈øpecified, you ≈øhall haue them beare flowers the next yeare after, and yeeld you encrea≈øe of ≈ølippes al≈øo. To giue you any ≈øet time, wherein the≈øe ≈ølippes will take roote, and begin to ≈øhoote aboue ground, is very hard to doe; for that euery ≈ølip, or yet euery kinde of Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loflower is not alike apt to grow; nor is euery earth in like manner fit to produce and bring forward the ≈ølippes that are ≈øet therein: but if both the ≈ølippe be apt to grow, and the earth of the be≈øt, fit to produce, I thinke within a fortnight or three weekes, you ≈øhall ≈øee them begin to put forth young leaues in the middle, or el≈øe it may be a moneth and more before you ≈øhall ≈øee any ≈øpringing. The be≈øt time likewi≈øe when to plant, is a ≈øpeciall thing to be knowne, and of as great con≈øequence as any thing el≈øe: For if you ≈ølippe and ≈øet in September, as many v≈øe to doe, or yet in Augu≈øt, as ≈øome may thinke will doe well, yet (vnle≈ø≈øe they be the mo≈øt ordinary ≈øorts, which are likely to grow at any time, and in any place) the mo≈øt of them, if not all, will either a≈ø≈øuredly peri≈øh, or neuer pro≈øper well: for the more excellent and dainty the Gilloflower is, the more tender for the mo≈øt part, and hard to nur≈øe vp will the ≈ølippes be. The be≈øt time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, that you cut off ≈øuch ≈ølippes as are likely, and ≈øuch as your rootes may ≈øpare, from the beginning of May vntill the middle of Iune at the furthe≈øt, and order them as I haue ≈øhewed you before, that ≈øo you may haue faire plants, plenty of flowers, and encrea≈øe ≈øufficient for new ≈øupply, without offence or lo≈ø≈øe of your ≈øtore. For the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching likewi≈øe of your earth, wherein you ≈øhall plant your ≈ølippes, that they may the better thriue and pro≈øper, diuers haue v≈øed diuers ≈øorts of manure; as ≈øtable ≈øoyle of hor≈øe, bea≈øts or kine, of ≈øheepe, and pigeons, all which are very good when they are thoroughly turned to mould, to mixe with your other earth, or being ≈øteeped in water, may ≈øerue to water the earth at times, and turned in with it. And ≈øome haue likewi≈øe proued Tanners earth, that is, their barke, which after they haue v≈øed, doth lye on heapes and rot in their yards, or the like mould from wood-≈øtackes or yards; but e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and beyond all other is commended the Willow earth, that is, that mould which is found in the hollow of old Willow trees, to be the mo≈øt principall to mixe with other good earth for this purpo≈øe. And as I haue now giuen you directions for the fir≈øt way to encrea≈øe them by ≈ølipping, ≈øo before I come to the other way, let mee giue you a caueat or two for the pre≈øeruing of them, when they are beginning to runne vtterly to decay and peri≈øh. The one is, that whereas many are ouer greedy to haue their plants to giue them flowers, and therefore let them runne all to flower, ≈øo farre ≈øpending them≈øelues thereby, that after they haue done flowring, they grow ≈øo weake, hauing out ≈øpent them≈øelues, that they cannot po≈ø≈øibly be pre≈øerued from the iniuries of the ≈øucceeding Winter; you ≈øhall therefore keepe the kinde of any ≈øort you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted withall, if you carefully looke that too many branches doe not runne vp and ≈øpindle for flowers, but rather either cut ≈øome of them downe, before they are run vp too high, within two or three ioynts of the rootes; or el≈øe plucke away the innermo≈øt leaues where it ≈øpringeth forwards, which you ≈øee in the middle of euery branch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be runne vp too high, which will cau≈øe them to breake out the fa≈øter into ≈ølips and ≈øuckers at the ioynts, to hinder their forward luxurie, and to pre≈øerue them the longer: The other is, If you ≈øhall perceiue any of your Gilloflower leaues to change their naturall fre≈øh verdure, and turne yellowi≈øh, or begin to wither in anie part or branch thereof, it is a ≈øure ≈øigne that the roote is infected with ≈øome cancker or rottenne≈ø≈øe, and will ≈øoone ≈øhew it ≈øelfe in all the re≈øt of the branches, whereby the plant will quickly be lo≈øt: to pre≈øerue it therefore, you ≈øhall be time, before it be runne too farre, (for otherwi≈øe it is impo≈ø≈øible to ≈øaue it) either couer all or mo≈øt of the branches with fre≈øh earth, or el≈øe take the faire≈øt ≈ølippes from it, as many as you can po≈ø≈øibly, and ca≈øt them into a pot or tubbe with water, and let them there abide for two or three daies at the lea≈øt: the fir≈øt way hath recouered many, being taken in time. Thus you ≈øhall ≈øee them recouer their former ≈øtiffene≈ø≈øe and colour, and then you may plant them as you haue beene heretofore directed; and although many of them may peri≈øh, yet ≈øhall you haue ≈øome of them that will grow to continue the kinde againe. The other or ≈øecond way to encrea≈øe Gilloflowers by planting, is, as I ≈øaid before, by in laying or laying downe the branches of them, and is a way of later inuention, and as frequently v≈øed, not onely for the tawney or yellow Gilloflower, and all the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therof, but with the other kinds of Gilloflowers, whereof experience hath ≈øhewed <pb n="20" facs="tcp:15790:17"/> that they will likewi≈øe take if they be ≈øo v≈øed; the manner whereof is thus: You mu≈øt choo≈øe out the younge≈øt, likelie≈øt, and lowe≈øt branches that are neare≈øt the ground (for the vpper branches will ≈øooner breake at the ioynt, than bend downe ≈øo low into the earth, without ≈øome pot with earth rai≈øed vp vnto them) and cut it on the vnder≈øide thereof vpwards at the ≈øecond ioynt next vnto the roote, to the middle of the branch, and no more, and not quite thorough in any ca≈øe, and then from that ≈øecond ioynt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third, ≈ølit or cut the branch in the middle longwi≈øe, that ≈øo it may be the more ea≈øily bended into the ground, the cut ioynt ≈øeeming like the end of a ≈ølippe, when you haue bended downe the branch where it is cut into the ground (which mu≈øt bee done very gently for feare of breaking) with a little ≈øticke or two thru≈øt ≈ølopewi≈øe, cro≈ø≈øe ouer it, keepe it downe within the earth, and rai≈øe vp ≈øufficient earth ouer it, that there it may lye and take roote, which commonly will be effected within ≈øixe weekes or two moneths in the Summer time, and then (or longer if you doubt the time too ≈øhort for it to take ≈øufficient roote) you may take or cut it away, and tran≈øplant it where you thinke good, yet ≈øo as in any ca≈øe you ≈øhadow it from the heate of the Sunne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it haue taken good hold in the ground. The other way to encrea≈øe Gilloflowers, is by ≈øowing the ≈øeede: It is not v≈øuall with all ≈øorts of Gilloflowers to giue ≈øeede, but ≈øuch of them as doe yeeld ≈øeede may be encrea≈øed thereby, in the ≈øame manner as is here ≈øet downe. The Orange tawney Gilloflower and the varieties thereof is the mo≈øt v≈øuall kinde, (and it is a kinde by it ≈øelfe, how various ≈øoeuer the plants be that ri≈øe from the ≈øeede) that doth giue ≈øeede, and is ≈øowne, and from thence ari≈øeth ≈øo many varieties of colours, both plaine and mixt, both ≈øingle and double, that one can hardly ≈øet them downe in writing: yet ≈øuch as I haue ob≈øerued and marked, you ≈øhall finde expre≈ø≈øed in the Chapter of Gilloflowers in the worke following. Fir≈øt therefore make choi≈øe of your ≈øeede that you intend to ≈øowe (if you doe not de≈øire to haue as many more ≈øingle flowers as double) that it bee taken from double flowers, and not from ≈øingle, and from the be≈øt colours, how≈øoeuer ≈øome may boa≈øt to haue had double and ≈øtript flowers from the ≈øeede of a ≈øingle one; which if it were ≈øo, yet one Swallow (as we ≈øay) maketh no Summer, nor a thing comming by chance cannot bee reckoned for a certaine and con≈øtant rule; you may be a≈ø≈øured they will not v≈øually doe ≈øo: but the be≈øt, faire≈øt, and mo≈øt double flowers come alwaies, or for the mo≈øt part, from the ≈øeede of tho≈øe flowers that were be≈øt, faire≈øt, and mo≈øt double, and I doe adui≈øe you to take the be≈øt and mo≈øt double: for euen from them you ≈øhall haue ≈øingle ones e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now, you neede not to ≈øowe any wor≈øer ≈øort. And againe, ≈øee that your ≈øeede bee new, of the la≈øt yeares gathering, and al≈øo that it was full ripe before it was gathered, le≈øt you lo≈øe your labour, or mi≈ø≈øe of your purpo≈øe, which is, to haue faire and double flowers. Hauing now made choi≈øe of your ≈øeede, and prepared you a bedde to ≈øowe them on, the earth whereof mu≈øt be rich and good, and likewi≈øe ≈øifted to make it the finer; for the better it is, the better ≈øhall your profit and plea≈øure bee: hereon, being fir≈øt made leuell, plaine, and ≈ømooth, ≈øowe your ≈øeede ≈øomewhat thinne, and not too thicke in any ca≈øe, and as euenly as you can, that they be not too many in one place, and too few in another, which afterwards couer with fine ≈øifted earth ouer them about one fingers thickne≈ø≈øe; let this be done in the middle of Aprill, if the time of the yeare be temperate, and not too cold, or el≈øe ≈øtay vntill the end of the moneth: after they are ≈øprung vp and growne to be ≈øomewhat bigge, let them bee drawne forth that are too clo≈øe and neare one vnto another, and plant them in ≈øuch place where they ≈øhall continue, ≈øo that they ≈øtand halfe a yard of ground di≈øtance a≈øunder, which after the planting, let be ≈øhadowed for a time, as is before ≈øpecified; and this may bee done in the end of Iuly, or ≈øooner if there becau≈øe. I haue not ≈øet downe in all this di≈øcour≈øe of planting, tran≈øplanting, ≈øowing, ≈øetting, &amp;c. any mention of watering tho≈øe ≈ølips or plants, not doubting but that euery ones rea≈øon will induce them to thinke, that they cannot pro≈øper without watering: But let this Caueat be a ≈øufficient remembrance vnto you, that you neuer water any of the≈øe Gilloflowers, nor yet indeede any other fine herbe or plant with cold water, ≈øuch as you haue pre≈øently before drawne out from a pumpe or Well, &amp;c. but with ≈øuch water as hath ≈øtood open in the aire in a ci≈øterne, tubbe, or pot, for one whole day at the lea≈øt; if it be two or three daies it will be neuer the wor≈øe, but rather the better, as I haue related before: yet take e≈øpeciall heede that you doe not giue them too much to ouer-glut them at any time, but temperately to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorate, <pb n="21" facs="tcp:15790:17"/> bedew or ≈øprinkle them often. From the ≈øeedes of the≈øe Gilloflowers hath ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen both white, red, blu≈øh, ≈øtamell, tawny lighter and ≈øadder, marbled, ≈øpeckled, ≈øtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, flaked, and that in diuers manners, both ≈øingle and double flowers, as you ≈øhall ≈øee them ≈øet downe in a more ample manner in the Chapter of Gilloflowers. And thus much for their encrea≈øe by the two wayes of planting and ≈øowing: For as for a third way, by grafting one into or vpon another, I know none ≈øuch to be true, nor to be of any more worth than an old Wiues tale, both nature, rea≈øon, and experience, all conte≈øting again≈øt ≈øuch an idle fancy, let men make what o≈øtentation they plea≈øe. It now re≈øteth, that we al≈øo ≈øhew you the manner how to pre≈øerue them, as well in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer from all noy≈øome and hurtfull things, as in the Winter and Spring from the ≈øharp and chilling colds, and the ≈øharpe and bitter killing windes in March. The hurtfull things in the Summer are e≈øpecially the≈øe, too much heate of the Sunne which ≈øcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, which you mu≈øt be carefull to preuent, by placing boughes, boords, clothes or mats, &amp;c. before them, if they bee in the ground; or el≈øe if they bee in pots, to remoue into them into the ≈øhadow, to giue them refre≈øhing from the heate, and giue them water al≈øo for their life: too much water, or too little is another annoyance, which you mu≈øt order as you ≈øee there is iu≈øt cau≈øe, by withholding or giuing them wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gently out of a watering pot, and not ca≈øt on by di≈øhfuls: Some al≈øo to water their Gilloflowers, v≈øe to ≈øet their pots into tubbes or pots halfe full of water, that ≈øo the water may ≈øoake in at the lower holes in each flower pot, to giue moi≈øture to the roots of the Gilloflowers onely, without ca≈øting any water vpon the leaues, and a≈ø≈øuredly it is an excellent way to moi≈øten the rootes ≈øo ≈øufficiently at one time, that it doth ≈øaue a great deale of paines many other times. Earwickes are a mo≈øt infe≈øtuous vermine, to ≈øpoyle the whole beauty of your flowers, and that in one night or day; for the≈øe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures delighting to creepe into any hollow or ≈øhadowie place, doe creepe into the long greene pods of the Gilloflowers, and doe eate away the white bottomes of their leaues, which are ≈øweete, whereby the leaues of the flowers being loo≈øe, doe either fall away of them≈øelues before, or when they are gathered, or handled, or pre≈øently wither within the pods before they are gathered, and blowne away with the winde. To auoide which inconuenience, many haue deui≈øed many waies and inuentions to de≈øtroy them, as pots with double verges or brimmes, containing a hollow gutter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, which being filled with water, will not ≈øuffer the≈øe ≈ømall vermine to pa≈ø≈øe ouer it to the Gilloflowers to ≈øpoile them. Others haue v≈øed old ≈øhooes, and ≈øuch like hollow things to bee ≈øet by them to take them in: but the be≈øt and mo≈øt v≈øuall things now v≈øed, are eyther long hollow canes, or el≈øe bea≈øts hoofes, which being turned downe vpon ≈øtickes ends ≈øet into the ground, or into the pots of earth, will ≈øoone draw into them many Earwickes, lying hid therein from ≈øunne, winde, and raine, and by care and diligence may ≈øoone bee de≈øtroyed, if euery morning and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one take the hoofes gently off from the ≈øtickes, and knocking them again≈øt the ground in a plain allie, ≈øhake out all the Earwicks that are crept into them, which quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ones foot may be trode to peeces. For ≈øodain bla≈øting with thunder and lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or fierce ≈øharpe windes, &amp;c. I know no other remedy, vnle≈ø≈øe you can couer them therefrom when you fir≈øt fore≈øee the danger, but patiently to abide the lo≈ø≈øe, what≈øoeuer ≈øome haue adui≈øed, to lay litter about them to auoide bla≈øting; for if any ≈øhall make tryall thereof, I am in doubt, he ≈øhall more endanger his rootes thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Summer time, when any ≈øuch feare of bla≈øting is, than any wi≈øe ≈øaue them from it, or doe them any good. For the Winter pre≈øeruation of them, ≈øome haue adui≈øed to couer them with Bee-hiues, or el≈øe with ≈ømall Willow ≈øtickes, prickt cro≈ø≈øewi≈øe into the ground ouer your flowers, and bowed archwi≈øe, and with litter laid thereon, to couer the Gilloflowers quite ouer, after they haue beene ≈øprinkled with ≈øope a≈øhes and lyme mixt together: and this way is commended by ≈øome that haue written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be ≈øuch an admirable defence vnto them in Winter, that neither Ants, nor Snailes, nor Earwickes ≈øhall touch them, becau≈øe of the ≈øope a≈øhes and lyme, and ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fro≈øts nor ≈øtormes ≈øhall hurt them, becau≈øe of the litter which ≈øo well will defend them; and hereby al≈øo your Gilloflowers will bee ready to flower, not onely in the Spring very early, but euen all the Winter. But who≈øoeuer ≈øhall follow the≈øe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may peraduenture finde them in ≈øome part true, as they are there ≈øet downe for the Winter time, and while they are kept clo≈øe and couered; but let them bee a≈ø≈øured, <pb n="22" facs="tcp:15790:18"/> that all ≈øuch plants, or the mo≈øt part of them, will certainely peri≈øh and dye before the Summer be at an end: for the ≈øope a≈øhes and lyme will burne vp and ≈øpoile any herbe; and againe, it is impo≈ø≈øible for any plant that is kept ≈øo warme in Winter, to abide ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cold or the winde in the Spring following, or any heate of the Sun, but that both of them will ≈øcorch them, and carry them quite away. One great hurt vnto them, and to all other herbes that wee pre≈øerue in Winter, is to ≈øuffer the ≈ønow to lye vpon them any time after it is fallen, for that it doth ≈øo chill them, that the Sunne afterward, although in Winter, doth ≈øcorch them and burne them vp: looke therefore vnto your Gilloflowers in tho≈øe times, and ≈øhake or ≈øtrike off the ≈ønow gently off from them, not ≈øuffering it to abide on them any day or night if you can; for a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelfe, if it doth not abide on them, the better they will be. The fro≈øts likewi≈øe is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great annoyance vnto them, to corrupt the rootes, and to cau≈øe them to ≈øwell, rot, and breake: to preuent which inconuenience, I would adui≈øe you to take the ≈øtraw or litter of your hor≈øe ≈øtable, and lay ≈øome thereof about euery roote of your Gillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers (e≈øpecially tho≈øe of the be≈øt account) clo≈øe vnto them vpon the ground, but be as carefull as you can, that none thereof lye vpon the greene leaues, or as little as may be, and by this onely way haue they been better defended from the fro≈øts that ≈øpoile them in Winter, then by any other that I haue ≈øeen or knowne. The windes in March, and Sunne≈øhine dayes then, are one of the greate≈øt inconueniences that happeneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: for they that haue had hundreds of plants, that haue kept faire and greene all the Winter vntill the beginning or middle of March, before the end thereof, haue had ≈øcarce one of many, that either hath not vtterly peri≈øhed, or been ≈øo tainted, that quickly after haue not been lo≈øt; which hath happened chiefly by the neglect of the≈øe cautions before ≈øpecified, or in not defending them from the bitter ≈øharpe windes and ≈øunne in this moneth of March. You ≈øhall therefore for their better pre≈øeruation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the litter laid about the rootes, which I adui≈øe you not to remoue as yet, ≈øhelter them ≈øomewhat from the windes, with eyther bottomle≈ø≈øe pots, pales, or ≈øuch like things, to keep away the violent force both of windes and ≈øun for that moneth, and for ≈øometime before &amp; after it al≈øo: yet ≈øo, that they be not couered clo≈øe aboue, but open to receiue ayre &amp; raine. Some al≈øo v≈øe to wind withes of hey or ≈øtraw about the rootes of their Gilloflowers, and fa≈øten them with ≈øtickes thru≈øt into the ground, which ≈øerue very well in the ≈øtead of the other. Thus haue I ≈øhewed you the whole pre≈øerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the≈øe worthy and dainty flowers, with the whole manner of ordering them for their encrea≈øe: if any one haue any other better way, I ≈øhall be as willing to learne it of them, as I haue beene to giue them or any others the knowledge of that I haue here ≈øet downe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> That there is not any art whereby any flower may be made to grow double, that was naturally ≈øingle, nor of any other ≈øent or colour than it fir≈øt had by nature; nor that the ≈øowing or planting of herbes one deeper than other, will cau≈øe them to be in flower one after another, euery moneth in the yeare.</head>
               <p>THe wonderfull de≈øire that many haue to ≈øee faire, double, and ≈øweete flowers, hath tran≈øported them beyond both rea≈øon and nature, feigning and boa≈øting often of what they would haue, as if they had it. And I thinke, from this de≈øire and boa≈øting hath ri≈øen all the fal≈øe tales and reports, of making flowers double as they li≈øt, and of giuing them colour and ≈øent as they plea≈øe, and to flower likewi≈øe at what time they will, I doubt not, but that ≈øome of the≈øe errours are ancient, and continued long by tradition, and others are of later inuention: and therefore the more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that men of wit and iudgement in the≈øe dayes ≈øhould expo≈øe them≈øelues in their writings, to be rather laughed at, then beleeued for ≈øuch idle tales. And although in the contradiction of them, I know I ≈øhall vndergoe many calumnies, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, I will endeauour to ≈øet downe and declare ≈øo much, as I hope may by rea≈øon <pb n="23" facs="tcp:15790:18"/> per≈øwade many in the truth, although I cannot hope of all, ≈øome being ≈øo ≈øtrongly wedded to their owne will, and the errours they haue beene bred in, that no rea≈øon may alter them. Fir≈øt therefore I ≈øay, that if there were any art to make ≈øome flowers to grow double, that naturally were ≈øingle, by the ≈øame art, all ≈øorts of flowers that are ≈øingle by nature, may be made to grow double: but the ≈øorts of flowers that are ≈øingle by nature, whereof ≈øome are double, were neuer made double by art; for many ≈øorts abide ≈øtill ≈øingle, whereof there was neuer ≈øeene double: and therefore there is no ≈øuch art in any mans knowledge to bring it to pa≈ø≈øe. If any man ≈øhall ≈øay, that becau≈øe there are many flowers double, whereof there are ≈øingle al≈øo of the ≈øame kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>, as for example, Violets, Marigolds, Dai≈øyes, Daffodils, Anemones, and many other, that therefore tho≈øe double flowers were ≈øo made by the art of man: <hi>viz.</hi> by the ob≈øeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the change of the Moone, the con≈øtellations or coniunctions of Planets, or ≈øome other Starres or cele≈øtiall bodies. Although I doe confe≈ø≈øe and acknowledge, that I thinke ≈øome con≈øtellations, and peraduenture changes of the Moone, &amp;c. were appointed by the God of nature, as conducing and helping to the making of tho≈øe flowers double, that nature hath ≈øo produced; yet I doe deny, that any man hath or ≈øhall euer be able to proue, that it was done by any art of man, or that any man can tell the true cau≈øes and ≈øea≈øons, what changes of the Moone, or con≈øtellations of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, wrought together for the producing of tho≈øe double flowers, or can imitate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or rather the God of nature, to doe the like. If it ≈øhall bee demanded, From whence then came the≈øe double flowers that we haue, if they were not ≈øo made by art? I an≈øwer, that a≈ø≈øuredly all ≈øuch flowers did fir≈øt grow wilde, and were ≈øo found dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as they doe now grow in Gardens, but for how long before they were found they became double, no man can tell; we onely haue them as nature hath produced them, and ≈øo they remaine. Againe, if any ≈øhall ≈øay, that it is likely that the≈øe double flowers were forced ≈øo to be, by the often planting and tran≈øplanting of them, becau≈øe it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerued in mo≈øt of them, that if they ≈øtand long in any one place, and not be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, they will grow ≈øtill le≈ø≈øe double, and in the end turne ≈øingle. I doe confe≈ø≈øe, that <hi>Facilior e≈øt de≈øcen≈øus qu√†m a≈øcen≈øus,</hi> and that the vnfruitfulne≈ø≈øe of the ground they are planted in, or the neglect or little care had of them, or the growing of them too thicke or too long, are oftentimes a cau≈øe of the dimini≈øhing of the flowers doublene≈ø≈øe; but withall you ≈øhall ob≈øerue, that the ≈øame rootes that did beare double flowers (and not any other that neuer were double before) haue returned to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doublene≈ø≈øe againe, by good ordering and looking vnto: ≈øingle flowers haue only beene made ≈øomewhat fairer or larger, by being planted in the richer and more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ground of the Garden, than they were found wilde by nature; but neuer made to grow double, as that which is naturally ≈øo found of it ≈øelfe: For I will ≈øhew you mine owne experience in the matter. I haue been as inqui≈øitiue as any man might be, with euery one I knew, that made any ≈øuch report, or that I thought could ≈øay any thing therein, but I neuer could finde any one, that could a≈ø≈øuredly re≈øolue me, that he knew certainly any ≈øuch thing to be done: all that they could ≈øay was but report, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeruation of the Moone, to remoue plants before the change, that is, as ≈øome ≈øay, the full of the Moone, others the new Moone, whereupon I haue made tryall at many times, and in many ≈øorts of plants, accordingly, and as I thought fit, by planting &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øplanting them, but I could neuer ≈øee the effect de≈øired, but rather in many of them the lo≈ø≈øe of my plants. And were there indeed ≈øuch a certaine art, to make ≈øingle flowers to grow double, it would haue beene knowne certainly to ≈øome that would practi≈øe it, and there are ≈øo many ≈øingle flowers, whereof there were neuer any of the kinde ≈øeene double, that to produce ≈øuch of them to be double, would procure both credit and coyne enough to him that ≈øhould v≈øe it; but <hi>Vltra po≈ø≈øe non e≈øt e≈ø≈øe:</hi> and therefore let no man beleeue any ≈øuch reports, bee they neuer ≈øo ancient; for they are but meere tales and fables. Concerning colours and ≈øents, the many rules and directions extant in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie mens writings, to cau≈øe flowers to grow yellow, red, greene, or white, that neuer were ≈øo naturally, as al≈øo to be of the ≈øent of Cinamon, Muske, &amp;c. would almo≈øt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade any, that the matters thus ≈øet downe by ≈øuch per≈øons, and with ≈øome ≈øhew of probability, were con≈øtant and a≈ø≈øured proofes thereof: but when they come to the triall, they all vani≈øh away like ≈ømoake. I will in a few words ≈øhew you the matters and manners of their proceedings to effect this purpo≈øe: Fir≈øt (they ≈øay) if you ≈øhall ≈øteepe <pb n="24" facs="tcp:15790:19"/> your ≈øeedes in the lees of red Wine, you ≈øhall haue the flowers of tho≈øe plants to be of a purple colour. If you will haue Lillies or Gilloflowers to be of a Scarlet red colour, you ≈øhall put Vermillion or Cynaber betweene the rinde and the ≈ømall heads growing about the roote: if you will haue them blew, you ≈øhall di≈ø≈øolue Azur or By≈øe between the rinde and the heads: if yellow, Orpiment: if greene, Vardigrea≈øe, and thus of any other colour. Others doe adui≈øe to open the head of the roote, and poure into it any colour di≈ø≈øolued, ≈øo that there be no fretting or corroding thing therein for feare of hurting the roote, and looke what colour you put in, iu≈øt ≈øuch or neare vnto it ≈øhall the colour of the flower bee. Some againe doe adui≈øe to water the plants you would haue changed, with ≈øuch coloured liquor as you de≈øire the flower to be of, and they ≈øhall grow to be ≈øo. Al≈øo to make Ro≈øes to bee yellow, that you ≈øhould graft a white Ro≈øe (≈øome ≈øay a Damaske) vpon a Broome ≈øtalke, and the flower will be yellow, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing becau≈øe the Broome flower is yellow, therefore the Ro≈øe will be yellow. Some affirme the like, if a Ro≈øe be grafted on a Barbery bu≈øh, becau≈øe both the blo≈ø≈øome and the barke of the Barbery is yellow, &amp;c. In the like manner for ≈øents, they haue ≈øet downe in their writings, that by putting Cloues, Muske, Cinamon, Benzoin, or any other ≈øuch ≈øweete thing, brui≈øed with Ro≈øe water, between the barke and the body of trees, the fruit of them will ≈ømell and ta≈øte of the ≈øame that is put vnto them; and if they bee put vnto the toppe of the rootes, or el≈øe bound vnto the head of the roote, they will cau≈øe the flowers to ≈ømell of that ≈øent the matter put vnto them is of: as al≈øo to ≈øteep the ≈øeeds of Ro≈øes, and other plants in the water of ≈øuch like ≈øweet things, and then to ≈øowe them, and water them morning and euening with ≈øuch like liquor, vntill they be growne vp; be≈øides a number of ≈øuch like rules and directions ≈øet downe in bookes, ≈øo confidently, as if the matters were without all doubt or que≈øtion: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as without all doubt and que≈øtion I will a≈ø≈øure you, that they are all but meere idle tales &amp; fancies, without all rea≈øon or truth, or ≈øhadow of rea≈øon or truth: For ≈øents and colours are both ≈øuch qualities as follow the e≈ø≈øence of plants, euen as formes are al≈øo; and one may as well make any plant to grow of what forme you will, as to make it of what ≈øent or colour you will; and if any man can forme plants at his will and plea≈øure, he can doe as much as God him≈øelfe that created them. For the things they would adde vnto the plants to giue them colour, are all corporeall, or of a bodily ≈øub≈øtance, and what≈øoeuer ≈øhould giue any colour vnto a liuing and growing plant, mu≈øt be ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall: for no ≈øolide corporeall ≈øub≈øtance can ioyne it ≈øelfe with the life and e≈ø≈øence of an herbe or tree, and the ≈øpirituall part of the colour thereof is not the ≈øame with the bodily ≈øub≈øtance, but is a meere vapour that ri≈øeth from the ≈øub≈øtance, and feedeth the plant, whereby it groweth, ≈øo that there is no ground or colour of rea≈øon, that a ≈øub≈øtantiall colour ≈øhould giue colour to a growing herbe or tree: but for ≈øent (which is a meere vapour) you will ≈øay there is more probability. Yet con≈øider al≈øo, that what ≈øweete ≈øent ≈øoeuer you binde or put vnto the rootes of herbes or trees, mu≈øt be either buried, or as good as buried in the earth, or barke of the tree, whereby the ≈øub≈øtance will in a ≈ømall time corrupt and rot, and before it can ioyne it ≈øelfe with the life, ≈øpirit, and e≈ø≈øence of the plant, the ≈øent al≈øo will peri≈øh with the ≈øub≈øtance: For no heterogeneall things can bee mixed naturally together, as Iron and Clay; and no other thing but homogeneall, can be nouri≈øhment or conuertible into the ≈øub≈øtance of man or bea≈øt: And as the ≈øtomach of man or bea≈øt altereth both formes, ≈øents, and colours of all dige≈øtible things; ≈øo what≈øoeuer ≈øent or colour is whol≈øome, and not poy≈øonfull to nature, being receiued into the body of man or bea≈øt, doth neither change the bloud or skinne into that colour or ≈øent was receiued: no more doth any colour or ≈øent to any plant; for the plants are onely nouri≈øhed by the moi≈øture they draw naturally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, be it of wine or any other liquor is put vnto them, and not by any corporeall ≈øub≈øtance, or heterogeneall vapour or ≈øent, becau≈øe the earth like vnto the ≈øtomach doth ≈øoone alter them, before they are conuerted into the nature and ≈øub≈øtance of the plant. Now for the la≈øt part I vndertooke to confute, that no man can by art make all flowers to ≈øpring at what time of the yeare hee will; although, as I haue here before ≈øhewed, there are flowers for euery moneth of the yeare, yet I hope there is not any one, that hath any knowledge in flowers and gardening, but knoweth that the flowers that appeare and ≈øhew them≈øelues in the ≈øeuerall moneths of the yeare, are not one and the ≈øame, and ≈øo made to flower by art; but that they are ≈øeuerall ≈øorts of plants, which <pb n="25" facs="tcp:15790:19"/> will flower naturally and con≈øtantly in the ≈øame moneths one yeare, that they v≈øe to doe in another, or with but little alteration, if the yeares proue not alike kindly: As for example, tho≈øe plants that doe flower in Ianuary and February, will by no art or indu≈øtry of man be cau≈øed to flower in Summer or in Autumne; and tho≈øe that flower in Aprill and May, will not flower in Ianuary or February; or tho≈øe in Iuly, Augu≈øt, &amp;c. either in the Winter or Spring: but euery one knoweth their owne appointed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall times, which they con≈øtantly ob≈øerue and keepe, according to the temperature of the yeare, or the temper of the climate, being further North or South, to bring them on earlier or later, as it doth with all other fruits, flowers, and growing greene herbes, &amp;c. except that by chance, ≈øome one or other extraordinarily may be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their due ≈øea≈øon of flowring, and ≈øo giue their flowers out of time, or el≈øe to giue their flowers twice in the yeare, by the ≈øuperaboundance of nouri≈øhment, or the mildne≈ø≈øe of the ≈øea≈øon, by moderate ≈øhowers of raine, &amp;c. as it ≈øometimes al≈øo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth with fruits, which chance, as it is ≈øeldome, and not con≈øtant, ≈øo we then terme it but <hi>Lu≈øus naturae:</hi> or el≈øe by forcing them in hot ≈øtoues, which then will peri≈øh, when they haue giuen their flowers or fruits. It is not then, as ≈øome haue written, the ≈øow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ≈øeedes of Lillies, or any other plants a foote deepe, or halfe a foote deepe, or two inches deepe, that will cau≈øe them to be in flower one after another, as they are ≈øowne euery moneth of the yeare; for it were too gro≈ø≈øe to thinke, that any man of rea≈øon and iudgement would ≈øo beleeue. Nor is it likewi≈øe in the power of any man, to make the ≈øame plants to abide a moneth, two, or three, or longer in their beauty of flowring, then naturally they v≈øe to doe; for I thinke that were no humane art, but a ≈øupernaturall worke. For nature ≈øtill bendeth and tendeth to perfection, that is, after flowring to giue fruit or ≈øeede; nor can it bee hindered in the cour≈øe thereof without manife≈øt danger of de≈øtruction, euen as it is in all other fruit-bearing creatures, which ≈øtay no longer, then their appointed time is naturall vnto them, without apparent damage. Some things I grant may be ≈øo ordered in the planting, that according to that order and time which is ob≈øerued in their planting, they ≈øhall ≈øhew forth their faire flowers, and they are Anemones, which will in that manner, that I haue ≈øhewed in the worke following, flower in ≈øeuerall moneths of the yeare; which thing as it is incident to none or very few other plants, and is found out but of late, ≈øo likewi≈øe is it knowne but vnto a very few. Thus haue I ≈øhewed you the true ≈øolution of the≈øe doubts: And although they haue not beene amplified with ≈øuch Philo≈øophicall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and rea≈øons, as one of greater learning might haue done, yet are they truely and ≈øincerely ≈øet downe, that they may ≈øerue <hi>tanquam galcatum,</hi> again≈øt all the calumnies and obiections of wilfull and obdurate per≈øons, that will not be reformed. As fir≈øt, that all double flowers were ≈øo found wilde, being the worke of nature alone, and not the art of any man, by planting or tran≈øplanting, at or before the new or full Moone, or any other ob≈øeruation of time, that hath cau≈øed the flower to grow double, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally was ≈øingle: Secondly, that the rules and directions, to cau≈øe flowers to bee of contrary or different colours or ≈øents, from that they were or would be naturally, are meere fancies of men, without any ground of rea≈øon or truth. And thirdly, that there is no power or art in man, to cau≈øe flowers to ≈øhew their beauty diuers moneths before their naturall time, nor to abide in their beauty longer then the appointed naturall time for euery one of them.</p>

                  <p>NExt vnto the Lillies, and before the Narci≈ø≈øi or Daffodils, the di≈øcour≈øe of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipas de≈øerueth his place, for that it partaketh of both their natures; agreeing with the Lillies in leaues, flowers, and ≈øeede, and ≈øomewhat with the Daffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dils in rootes. There are not onely diuers kindes of Tulipas, but ≈øundry diuer≈øities of colours in them, found out in the≈øe later dayes by many the ≈øearchers of natures va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, which haue not formerly been ob≈øerued: our age being more delighted in the ≈øearch, curio≈øity, and rarities of the≈øe plea≈øant delights, then any age I thinke before. But indeede, this flower, aboue many other, de≈øerueth his true commendations and acceptance with all louers of the≈øe beauties, both for the ≈øtately a≈øpect, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable varietie of colours, that daily doe ari≈øe in them, farre beyond all other plants that grow, in ≈øo much, that I doubt, although I ≈øhall in this Chapter ≈øet downe the varieties of a great many, I ≈øhall leaue more vn≈øpoken of, then I ≈øhall de≈øcribe; for I may well ≈øay, there is in this one plant no end of diuer≈øity to be expected, euery yeare yeelding a mixture and variety that hath not before been ob≈øerued, and all this ari≈øing from the ≈øowing of the ≈øeede. The chiefe diui≈øion of Tulipas, is into two ≈øorts:
<hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coces,</hi> early flowring Tulipas, and <hi>Serotinae,</hi> late flowring Tulipas. For that ≈øort which is called <hi>Mediae</hi> or
<hi>Dubiae,</hi> that is, which flower in the middle time betweene them both, and may be thought to be a kinde or ≈øort by it ≈øelfe, as well as any of the other two: yet becau≈øe they doe neerer participate with the
<hi>Serotinae</hi> then with the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> not onely in the colour of the leafe, being of the ≈øame greenne≈ø≈øe with the <hi>Serotinae,</hi> and mo≈øt v≈øually al≈øo, for that it beareth his ≈øtalke and flower, high and large like as the <hi>Serotinae</hi> doe; but e≈øpecially, for that the ≈øeede of a <hi>Media Tulipa</hi> did neuer bring forth a <hi>Praecox</hi> flower (although I know Clu≈øius, an indu≈øtrious, learned, and painfull ≈øearcher and publi≈øher of the≈øe rarities, ≈øaith otherwi≈øe) ≈øo farre as euer I could, by mine owne care or knowledge, in ≈øowing their ≈øeede apart, or the a≈ø≈øurance of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the louers and ≈øowers of Tulipa ≈øeede, ob≈øerue, learne, or know: and becau≈øe al≈øo that the ≈øeede of the <hi>Serotinae</hi> bringeth forth <hi>Medias,</hi> and the ≈øeede of
<hi>Medias Sero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinae,</hi> they may well bee comprehended vnder the generall title of <hi>Serotinae:</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they haue generally receiued the name of <hi>Media,</hi> or middle flowring Tulipas, to di≈øtingui≈øh betweene them, and tho≈øe that v≈øually doe flower after them; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ≈øet them downe, and ≈øpeake of them ≈øeuerally, as of three ≈øorts. Vnto the place and ranke likewi≈øe of the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> or early flowring Tulipas, there are ≈øome other ≈øeuerall kinds of Tulipas to be added, which are notably differing, not onely from the former <hi>Praecox Tulipa,</hi> but euery one of them, one from another, in ≈øome ≈øpeciall note or other: as the
<hi>Tulipa Bolonien≈øis flore rubro,</hi> the red Bolonia Tulipa. <hi>Tulipa Bolonien≈øis flore luteo,</hi> the yellow Bolonia Tulipa. <hi>Tulipa Per≈øica,</hi> the Per≈øian Tulipa. <hi>Tulipa Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> the Candie Tulipa, and others: all which ≈øhall bee de≈øcribed and entreated of, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one apart by it ≈øelfe, in the end of the ranke of the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> becau≈øe all of them flower much about their time. To begin then with the
<hi>Praecox,</hi> or early flowring Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipas, and after them with the
<hi>Medias</hi> and <hi>Serotines,</hi> I ≈øhall for the better method, diuide their flowers into foure primary or principall colours, that is to ≈øay, White, Purple, Red, and Yellow, and vnder euery one of the≈øe colours, ≈øet downe the ≈øeuerall varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <pb n="46" facs="tcp:15790:30"/> of mixtures we haue ≈øeene and ob≈øerued in them, that ≈øo they may be both the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter de≈øcribed by me, and the better conceiued by others, and euery one placed in their proper ranke. Yet I ≈øhall in this, as I intend to doe in diuers other plants that are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, giue but one de≈øcription in generall of the plant, and then ≈øet downe the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of forme or colour afterwards briefly by them≈øelues.</p>

                  <p>This Tulipa is very like vnto the yellow Bolonia Tulipa, both in roote, leafe, and flower, as al≈øo in the colour thereof, being yellow: the onely difference is, that it is in all things le≈ø≈øer and lower, and is not ≈øo apt to beare, nor ≈øo plentifull to encrea≈øe by the roote.</p>

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:15790:38"/>There yet remaine many ob≈øeruations, concerning the≈øe beautifull flowers, fit to be knowne, which could not, without too much prolixity, be comprehended within the body of the de≈øcription of them; but are re≈øerued to bee intreated of a part by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues.</p>
                  <p>All ≈øorts of Tulipas beare v≈øually but one ≈øtalke, and that without any branches: but ≈øometimes nature is ≈øo plentifull in bearing, that it hath two or three ≈øtalkes, and ≈øometimes two, or more branches out of one ≈øtalke (euery ≈øtalke or branch bearing one flower at the toppe) but this is but ≈øeldome ≈øeene; and when it doth happen once, it is hardly ≈øeene againe in the ≈øame roote, but is a great ≈øigne, that the roote that doth thus, being an old roote, will the ≈øame yeare part into diuers rootes, whereof euery one, being of a rea≈øonable greatne≈ø≈øe, will beare both his ≈øtalke and flower the next yeare, agreeing with the mother plant in colour, as all the of-≈øets of Tulipas doe for the mo≈øt part: for although the young of-≈øets of ≈øome doe vary from the maine roote, euen while it groweth with them, yet being ≈øeparated, it will bee of the ≈øame colour with the mother plant.</p>
                  <p>There groweth oftentimes in the <hi>Medias,</hi> and ≈øometimes al≈øo in the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> but more ≈øeldome, a ≈ømall bulbe or roote, hard aboue the ground, at the bottome of the ≈øtalke, and betweene it and the lower leafe, which when the ≈øtalke is dry, and it ripe, being put into the ground, will bring forth in time a flower like vnto the mother plant, from whence it was taken.</p>
                  <p>The flowers al≈øo of Tulipas con≈øi≈øt mo≈øt commonly of ≈øixe leaues, but ≈øometimes they are ≈øeene to haue eight or tenne, or more leaues; but v≈øually, tho≈øe rootes beare but their ordinary number of ≈øixe leaues the next yeare: the head for ≈øeede then, is for the mo≈øt part foure ≈øquare, which at all other times is but three ≈øquare, or when the flower wanteth a leafe or two, as ≈øometimes al≈øo it doth, it then is flat, hauing but two ≈øides.</p>
                  <p>The forme of the flower is al≈øo very variable; for the leaues of ≈øome Tulipas are all ≈øharpe pointed, or all blunt and round pointed, and many haue the three outer leaues ≈øharpe pointed, and the three inner round or pointed, and ≈øome contrariwi≈øe, the three outermo≈øt round pointed, and the three inner ≈øharpe pointed. Againe, ≈øome haue all the leaues of the flowers long and narrow, and ≈øome haue them broader and ≈øhorter. Some <hi>Praecoces</hi> al≈øo haue their flowers very large and great, equall vnto eyther the <hi>Media,</hi> or <hi>Serotina,</hi> which mo≈øt commonly are the large≈øt, and others haue them as ≈ømall as the Bolonia Tulipa.</p>
                  <p>The bottomes of the leaues of the flowers are al≈øo variably diuer≈øified, and ≈øo are both the chiues or threeds that ≈øtand vp about the head, and the tips or pendents that are hanging loo≈øe on the toppes of them; and by the difference of the bottomes or chiues, many flowers are di≈øtingui≈øhed, which el≈øe are very like in colour, and alike al≈øo marked.</p>
                  <p>For the ≈ømell al≈øo there is ≈øome diuer≈øity; for that the flowers of ≈øome are very ≈øweete, of others nothing at all, and ≈øome betweene both, of a ≈ømall ≈øent, but not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiue: and yet ≈øome I haue ob≈øerued haue had a ≈øtrong ill ≈øent; but how to ≈øhew you to di≈øtingui≈øh them, more then by your owne ≈øen≈øe, I cannot: for the ≈øeedes of ≈øweete ≈ømelling Tulipas doe not follow their mother plant, no more then they doe in the colour.</p>
                  <p>And la≈øtly, take this, which is not the lea≈øt ob≈øeruation, worth the noting, that I haue ob≈øerued in many: When they haue beene of one entire colour for diuers yeares, yet in ≈øome yeare they haue altered very much, as if it had not beene the ≈øame, <hi>viz.</hi> from a purple or ≈øtamell, it hath beene variably either parted, or mixed, or ≈øtriped with white, eyther in part, or through the whole flower, and ≈øo in a red or yellow flower, that it hath had eyther red or yellow edges, or yellow or red ≈øpots, lines, veines, or flames, running through the red or yellow colour, and ≈øometimes it hath happened, that three leaues haue been equally parted in the middle with red and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the other three abiding of one colour, and in ≈øome the red had ≈øome yellow in it, and the yellow ≈øome red ≈øpots in it al≈øo; whereof I haue ob≈øerued, that all ≈øuch flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not hauing their originall in that manner, (for ≈øome that haue ≈øuch or the like markes from the beginning, that is, from the fir≈øt and ≈øecond yeares flowring, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant, and doe not change) but as I ≈øaid, were of one colour at the fir≈øt, doe ≈øhew the <pb n="63" facs="tcp:15790:38"/> weakne≈ø≈øe and decay of the roote, and that this extraordinary beauty in the flower, is but as the brightne≈ø≈øe of a light, vpon the very extingui≈øhing thereof, and doth plainly declare, that it can doe his Ma≈øter no more ≈øeruice, and therefore with this iollity doth bid him good night. I know there is a common opinion among many (and very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently maintained) that a Tulipa with a white flower, hath changed to beare a red or yellow, and ≈øo of the red or yellow, and other colours, that they are likewi≈øe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant, as though no flowers were certaine: but I could neuer either ≈øee or heare for certaine any ≈øuch alteration, nor any other variation, but what is formerly expre≈ø≈øed. Let not therefore any iudicious be carried away with any ≈øuch idle conceit, but rather ≈øu≈øpect ≈øome deceit in their Gardeners or others, by taking vp one, and putting in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the place, or el≈øe their owne mi≈øtaking.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ≈øowing, planting, tran≈øplanting, choi≈øe, and ordering of Tulipas, which is not the lea≈øt of regard, concerning this ≈øubiect in hand, but (as I think) would be willingly entertained; What I haue by my be≈øt endeauours learned, by mine owne paines in almo≈øt forty yeares trauell, or from others informations, I am willing here to ≈øet downe; not doubting, but that ≈øome may adde what hath not come to my knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, in the ≈øowing of ≈øeedes of Tulipas, I haue not ob≈øerued (what≈øoeuer others haue written) nor could of certainty learne of others, that there doth ari≈øe from the ≈øeedes of <hi>Praecoces</hi> any
<hi>Medias</hi> or <hi>Serotine</hi> Tulipas, (or but very ≈øeldome) nor am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a≈ø≈øured of any: but that the ≈øeedes of all <hi>Praecoces</hi> (≈øo they be not doubtfull, or of the la≈øt flowring ≈øorts) will bring
<hi>Praecoces:</hi> And I am out of doubt, that I neuer ≈øaw, nor could learne, that euer the ≈øeede of the <hi>Medias</hi> or <hi>Serotines</hi> haue giuen <hi>Praecoces;</hi> but <hi>Medias</hi> or <hi>Serotines,</hi> according to their naturall kinde. But if there ≈øhould bee any degeneration, I rather incline to thinke, that it ≈øooner commeth to pa≈ø≈øe (<hi>√† meliore ad peius,</hi> for <hi>facilis e≈øt de≈øcen≈øus,</hi> that is) that
<hi>Praecoces</hi> may giue <hi>Medias,</hi> then that <hi>Medias</hi> or
<hi>Serotines</hi> ≈øhould giue <hi>Praecoces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the choi≈øe of your ≈øeede to ≈øowe. Fir≈øt, for the
<hi>Praecoces,</hi> Clu≈øius ≈øaith, that the <hi>Praecox Tulipa,</hi> that beareth a white flower, is the be≈øt to giue the greate≈øt variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Some among vs haue reported, that they haue found great variety ri≈øe from the ≈øeede of the red <hi>Praecox,</hi> which I can more hardly beleeue: but Clu≈øius his experience hath the greater probability, but e≈øpecially if it haue ≈øome mixture of red or purple in it. The purple I haue found to be the be≈øt, next thereunto is the purple with white edges, and ≈øo likewi≈øe the red with yellow edges, each of them will bring mo≈øt of their owne colours. Then the choi≈øe of the be≈øt <hi>Medias,</hi> is to take tho≈øe colours that are light, rather white then yellow, and purple then red; yea white, not yellow, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not red: but the≈øe againe to be ≈øpotted is the be≈øt, and the more the better; but withall, or aboue all in the≈øe, re≈øpect the ground or bottome of the flower, (which in the <hi>Praecox Tulipa</hi> cannot, becau≈øe you ≈øhall ≈øeldome ≈øee any other ground in them but yellow) for if the flower be white, or whiti≈øh, ≈øpotted, or edged, and ≈øtraked, and the bottome blew or purple (≈øuch as is found in the Holias, and in the Cloth of ≈øiluer, this is beyond all other the mo≈øt excellent, and out of que≈øtion the choi≈øe≈øt of an hundred, to haue the greate≈øt and mo≈øt plea≈øant variety and rarity. And ≈øo in degree, the meaner in beauty you ≈øowe, the le≈ø≈øer ≈øhall your plea≈øure in rarities be. Be≈øtowe not your time in ≈øowing red or yellow Tulipa ≈øeede, or the diuers mixtures of them; for they will (as I haue found by experience) ≈øeldome be worth your paines. The <hi>Serotina,</hi> or late flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Tulipa, becau≈øe it is ≈øeldome ≈øeene, with any e≈øpeciall beautifull variety, you may ea≈øily your ≈øelues ghe≈ø≈øe that it can bring forth (euen as I haue al≈øo learned) no raritie, and little or no diuer≈øity at all.</p>
                  <p>The time and manner to ≈øowe the≈øe ≈øeedes is next to be con≈øidered. You may not ≈øowe them in the ≈øpring of the yeare, if you hope to haue any good of them; but in the Autumne, or pre≈øently after they be thorough ripe and dry: yet if you ≈øowe them not vntill the end of October, they will come forward neuer the wor≈øe, but rather the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for it is often ≈øeene, that ouer early ≈øowing cau≈øeth them to ≈øpring out of the ground ouer early, ≈øo that if a ≈øharpe ≈øpring chance to follow, it may goe neere to ≈øpoile all, or the mo≈øt of your ≈øeede. Wee v≈øually ≈øowe the ≈øame yeares ≈øeede, yet if you chance to keepe of your owne, or haue from others ≈øuch ≈øeed, as is two years old, they will thriue and doe well enough, e≈øpecially if they were ripe and well gathered: <pb n="64" facs="tcp:15790:39"/> You mu≈øt not ≈øowe them too thicke, for ≈øo doing hath lo≈øt many a pecke of good ≈øeede, as I can tell; for if the ≈øeede lye one vpon another, that it hath not roome vpon the ≈øprouting, to enter and take roote in the earth, it peri≈øheth by and by. Some v≈øe to tread downe the ground, where they meane to ≈øowe their ≈øeede, and hauing ≈øowne them thereon, doe couer them ouer the thickne≈ø≈øe of a mans thumbe with fine ≈øifted earth, and they thinke they doe well, and haue good rea≈øon for it: for con≈øidering the nature of the young Tulipa rootes, is to runne downe deeper into the ground, euery yeare more then other, they thinke to hinder their quicke de≈øcent by the fa≈øtne≈ø≈øe of the ground, that ≈øo they may encrea≈øe the better. This way may plea≈øe ≈øome, but I doe not v≈øe it, nor can finde the rea≈øon ≈øufficient; for they doe not con≈øider, that the ≈øtiffene≈ø≈øe of the earth, doth cau≈øe the rootes of the young Tulipas to bee long before they grow great, in that a ≈øtiffe ground doth more hinder the well thriuing of the rootes, then a loo≈øe doth, and although the rootes doe runne downe deeper in a loo≈øe earth, yet they may ea≈øily by tran≈øplanting be holpen, and rai≈øed vp high enough. I haue al≈øo ≈øeene ≈øome Tulipas not once remoued from their ≈øowing to their flowring; but if you will not lo≈øe them, you mu≈øt take them vp while their leafe or ≈øtalke is fre≈øh, and not withered: for if you doe not follow the ≈øtalke downe to the roote, be it neuer ≈øo deepe, you will leaue them behinde you. The ground al≈øo mu≈øt be re≈øpected; for the finer, ≈øofter, and richer the mould is, wherein you ≈øowe your ≈øeede, the greater ≈øhall be your encrea≈øe and varietie: Sift it therefore from all ≈øtones and rubbi≈øh, and let it be either fat naturall ground of it ≈øelfe, or being muckt, that it bee thoroughly rotten: but ≈øome I know, to mend their ground, doe make ≈øuch a mixture of grounds, that they marre it in the making.</p>
                  <p>After the ≈øeede is thus ≈øowne, the fir≈øt yeares ≈øpringing bringeth forth leaues, little bigger then the ordinary gra≈ø≈øe leaues; the ≈øecond yeare bigger, and ≈øo by degrees euery yeare bigger then other. The leaues of the <hi>Praecoces</hi> while they are young, may be di≈øcerned from the <hi>Medias</hi> by this note, which I haue ob≈øerued. The leaues of them doe wholly ≈øtand vp aboue the ground, ≈øhewing the ≈ømall foot≈øtalkes, whereby euerie leafe doth ≈øtand, but the leaues of the
<hi>Medias</hi> or <hi>Serotines</hi> doe neuer wholly appeare out of the ground, but the lower part which is broad, abideth vnder the vpper face of the earth. Tho≈øe Tulipas now growing to bee three yeares old, (yet ≈øome at the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, if the ground and ayre be corre≈øpondent) are to bee taken vp out of the ground, wherein yee ≈øhall finde they haue runne deepe, and to be anew planted, after they haue been a little dryed and clean≈øed, eyther in the ≈øame, or another ground againe, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them rea≈øonable neare one vnto another, according to their greatne≈ø≈øe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted and couered ouer with earth againe, of about an inch or two thickne≈ø≈øe, may be left vntaken vp againe for two yeare longer, if you will, or el≈øe remoued euery yeare after, as you plea≈øe; and thus by tran≈øplanting them in their due ≈øea≈øon (which is ≈øtill in the end of Iuly, or beginning of Augu≈øt, or thereabouts) you ≈øhall according to your ≈øeede and ≈øoyle, haue ≈øome come to bearing, in the fifth yeare after the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, (and ≈øome haue had them in the fourth, but that hath beene but few, and none of the be≈øt, or in a rich ground) ≈øome in the ≈øixth and ≈øeuenth, and ≈øome peraduenture, not vntill the eighth or tenth yeare: but ≈øtill remember, that as your rootes growe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that in re-planting you giue them the more roome to be di≈øtant one from another, or el≈øe the one will hinder, if not rot the other.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øeede of the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> doe not thriue and come forward ≈øo fa≈øt as the <hi>Medias</hi> or <hi>Serotines,</hi> nor doe giue any of-≈øets in their running downe as the <hi>Medias</hi> doe, which v≈øually leaue a ≈ømall roote at the head of the other that is runne downe euery yeare; and be≈øides, are more tender, and require more care and attendance then the <hi>Medias,</hi> and therefore they are the more re≈øpected.</p>
                  <p>This is a generall and certaine rule in all Tulipas, that all the while they beare but one leafe, they will not beare flower, whether they bee ≈øeedlings, or the of-≈øets of elder rootes, or the rootes them≈øelues, that haue heretofore borne flowers; but when they ≈øhew a ≈øecond leafe, breaking out of the fir≈øt, it is a certaine ≈øigne, that it will then beare a flower, vnle≈ø≈øe ≈øome ca≈øualty hinder it, as fro≈øt or raine, to nip or ≈øpoile the bud, or other vntimely accident befall it.</p>
                  <p>To ≈øet or plant your be≈øt and bearing Tulipas ≈øomewhat deeper then other rootes, I hold it the be≈øt way; for if the ground bee either cold, or lye too open to the cold <pb n="65" facs="tcp:15790:39"/> Northerne ayre, they will be the better defended therein, and not ≈øuffer the fro≈øts or cold to pierce them ≈øo ≈øoone: for the deepe fro≈øts and ≈ønowes doe pinch the
<hi>Praecoces</hi> chiefly, if they bee too neare the vppermo≈øt cru≈øt of the earth; and therefore many, with good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, couer ouer their ground before Winter, with either fre≈øh or old rotten dung, and that will maruellou≈øly pre≈øerue them. The like cour≈øe you may hold with ≈øeedlings, to cau≈øe them to come on the forwarder, ≈øo it bee after the fir≈øt yeares ≈øowing, and not till then.</p>
                  <p>To remoue Tulipas after they haue ≈øhot forth their fibres or ≈ømall ≈øtrings, which grow vnder the great round rootes, (that is, from September vntill they bee in flower) is very dangerous; for by remouing them when they haue taken fa≈øt hold in the ground, you doe both hinder them in the bearing out their flower, and be≈øides, put them in hazzard to peri≈øh, at lea≈øt to bee put backe from bearing for a while after, as oftentimes I haue proued by experience: But when they are now ri≈øen to flower, and ≈øo for any time after, you may ≈øafely take them vp if you will, and remoue them without danger, if you haue any good regard vnto them, vnle≈ø≈øe it be a young bearing roote, which you ≈øhall in ≈øo doing much hinder, becau≈øe it is yet tender, by rea≈øon it now beareth his fir≈øt flower. But all Tulipa roots when their ≈øtalke and leaues are dry, may mo≈øt ≈øafely then be taken vp out of the ground, and be ≈øo kept (≈øo that they lye in a dry, and not in a moi≈øt place) for ≈øixe moneths, without any great harme: yea I haue knowne them that haue had them nine moneths out of the ground, and haue done rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable well, but this you mu≈øt vnder≈øtand withall, that they haue not been young but elder rootes, and they haue been orderly taken vp and pre≈øerued. The dryer you keep a Tulipa roote the better, ≈øo as you let it not lye in the ≈øunne or winde, which will pierce it and ≈øpoile it.</p>

And Bauhinus, vpon Matthiolus Commentaries of Dio≈øcorides, and in his Pinax al≈øo, followeth his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Camerarius in his Hortus Medicus is of opinion, it may be referred to the Helychry≈øum of Crateua. Ge≈øner, as I thinke, fir≈øt of all, and after him Lobel, Camerarius, Clu≈øius and many others, referre it to the Satyrium of Dio≈øcorides: and ≈øurely this opinion is the mo≈øt probable for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons. Fir≈øt, for that this plant doth grow very frequent in many places of Greece, and the le≈ø≈øer A≈øia, which were no doubt ≈øufficiently knowne both to Theophra≈øtus, and Dio≈øcorides, and was accounted among bulbous rootes, although by ≈øundry names. And ≈øecondly, as Dio≈øcorides ≈øetteth forth his Satyrium, ≈øo this mo≈øt commonly beareth three leaues vpon a ≈øtalke (although ≈øometimes with vs it hath foure or fiue) like vnto a Lilly, whereof ≈øome are often ≈øeen to be both red, in the fir≈øt ≈øpringing, and al≈øo vpon the decaying, e≈øpecially in a dry time, and in a dry ground: the flower likewi≈øe of ≈øome is white, and like a Lilly; the roote is round, and as white within as the white of an egge, couered with a browne coate, hauing a ≈øweeti≈øh, but not vnplea≈øant ta≈øte, as any man without danger many try. This de≈øcription doth ≈øo liuely ≈øet forth this plant, that I thinke wee ≈øhall not neede to be any longer in doubt, where to finde Dio≈øcorides his Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Triphyllum, ≈øeeing wee haue ≈øuch plenty growing with vs. And thirdly, there is no doubt, but that it hath the ≈øame qualities, as you ≈øhall hereafter heare further. And la≈øtly, that plant likewi≈øe that beareth a red flower, may very well agree with his Erythronium; for the de≈øcriptions in Dio≈øcorides are both alike, as are their qualities, the greate≈øt doubt may be in the ≈øeede, which yet may agree vnto Lin or Flaxe as fitly, or rather more then many other plants doe, in many of his compari≈øons, which yet wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue for currant.

                  <p>THere hath beene great confu≈øion among many of our moderne Writers of plants, in not di≈øtingui≈øhing the manifold varieties of Daffodils; for euery one almo≈øt, without con≈øideration of kinde or forme, or other ≈øpeciall note, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth names ≈øo diuer≈øly one from another, that if any one ≈øhall receiue from ≈øeuerall places the Catalogues of their names (as I haue had many) as they ≈øet them down, and compare the one Catalogue with the other, he ≈øhall ≈øcarce haue three names in a dozen to agree together, one calling that by one name, which another calleth by another, that very few can tell what they meane. And this their confu≈øion, in not di≈øtingui≈øhing the name of <hi>Narci≈ø≈øus</hi> from
<hi>P≈øeudonarci≈ø≈øus,</hi> is of all other in this kinde the greate≈øt and gro≈ø≈øe≈øt errour. To auoide therefore that gulfe, whereof I complaine that ≈øo manie haue bin endrenched; and to reduce the Daffodils into ≈øuch a methodicall order, that euery one may know, to what <hi>Cla≈øsis</hi> or forme any one doth appertaine, I will fir≈øt diuide them into two principall or primary kindes: that is, into <hi>Narci≈ø≈øos,</hi> true Daffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dils, and
<hi>P≈øeudonarci≈ø≈øos,</hi> ba≈øtard Daffodils: which di≈øtinction I hold to be mo≈øt nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarie to be ≈øet downe fir≈øt of all that euery one may be named without confu≈øion vnder his owne primary kind, and then to let the other parts of the ≈øubdiui≈øion follow, as is proper to them, and fitte≈øt to expre≈ø≈øe them. Now to cau≈øe you to vnder≈øtand the difference betweene a true Daffodill and a fal≈øe, is this; it con≈øi≈øteth onely in the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (when as in all other parts they cannot bee di≈øtingui≈øhed) and chiefly in the middle cup or chalice; for that we doe in a manner onely account tho≈øe to bee <hi>P≈øeudonarci≈ø≈øos,</hi> ba≈øtard Daffodils, who≈øe middle cup is altogether as long, and ≈øometime a little longer then the outter leaues that doe encompa≈ø≈øe it, ≈øo that it ≈øeemeth rather like a trunke or long no≈øe, then a cup or chalice, ≈øuch as almo≈øt all the <hi>Narci≈øsi,</hi> or true Daffodils haue; I ≈øay almo≈øt, becau≈øe I know that ≈øome of them haue their middle cup ≈øo ≈ømall, that we rather call it a crowne then a cup; and againe, ≈øome of them haue them ≈øo long, that they may ≈øeem to be of the number of the
<hi>P≈øeudonarci≈øsi,</hi> or ba≈øtard Daffodils: but yet may ea≈øily be knowne from them, in that, although the cup of ≈øome of the true Daffodils be great, yet it is wider open at the brim or edge, and not ≈øo long and narrow all alike as the ba≈øtard kindes are, and this is the chiefe and onely way to know how to ≈øeuer the≈øe kindes, which rule holdeth certaine in all, except that kinde which is called <hi>Narcci≈ø≈øus luncifolius reflexo flora,</hi> who≈øe cup is narrow, and as long as the leaues that turne vp againe.</p>

                  <p>This double Anemone al≈øo is very like the la≈øt de≈øcribed Anemone, but that in the middle of the purple thrums, there thru≈øteth forth a tuft of threads or leaues of a more light crim≈øon colour.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the kindes of Anemones or Windflowers, ≈øo farre forth as haue hitherto come to our knowledge; yet I doubt not, but that more varieties haue beene el≈øewhere collected, and will be al≈øo in our Countrey daily and yearly ob≈øerued by diuers, that rai≈øe them vp from ≈øowing the ≈øeede, wherein lyeth a pretty art, not yet fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly knowne to our Nation, although it be very frequent in the Lowe-Countries, where their indu≈øtry hath bred and nouri≈øhed vp ≈øuch diuer≈øities and varieties, that they haue valued ≈øome Anemones at ≈øuch high rates, as mo≈øt would wonder at, and none of our Nation would purcha≈øe, as I thinke. And I doubt not, if wee would be as curious as they, but that both our ayre and ≈øoyle would produce as great variety, as euer hath been ≈øeene in the Lowe-Countries; which to procure, if any of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will take ≈øo much paines in ≈øowing the ≈øeedes of Anemones, as diuers haue done of Tulipas: I will ≈øet them downe the be≈øt directions for that purpo≈øe that I haue learned, or could by much ≈øearch and tryall attaine vnto; yet I mu≈øt let them vnder≈øtand thus much al≈øo, that there is not ≈øo great variety of double flowers rai≈øed from the ≈øeede of the thin leafed Anemones, as from the broad leafed ones.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt therefore (as I ≈øaid before) concerning Tulipas, there is ≈øome ≈øpeciall choice to be made of ≈øuch flowers, who≈øe ≈øeed is fitte≈øt to be taken. Of the <hi>Latifolias,</hi> the double Orenge tawney ≈øeede being ≈øowne, yeeldeth pretty varieties, but the purples, and reds, or crim≈øons, either <hi>Latifolias</hi> or <hi>Tenuifolias,</hi> yeeld ≈ømall variety, but ≈øuch as draw neare≈øt to their originall, although ≈øome be a little deeper or lighter then others. But the light colours be they which are the chiefe for choice, as white, a≈øh-colour, blu≈øh or carnation, light orenge, ≈øimple or party coloured, ≈øingle or double, if they beare ≈øeede, which mu≈øt bee carefully gathered, and that not before it bee thorough ripe, which you ≈øhall know by the head; for when the ≈øeede with the wolline≈ø≈øe beginneth to ri≈øe a little of it ≈øelfe at the lower end, it mu≈øt bee then quickly gathered, le≈øt the winde carry it all away. After it is thus carefully gathered, it mu≈øt be laid to dry for a weeke or more, which then being gently rubbed with a little dry ≈øand or earth, will cau≈øe the ≈øeede to be ≈øomewhat better ≈øeparated, although not thoroughly from the woolline≈ø≈øe or downe that compa≈ø≈øeth it.</p>
                  <p>Within a moneth at the mo≈øt after the ≈øeede is thus gathered and prepared, it mu≈øt be ≈øowne; for by that meanes you ≈øhall gaine a yeare in the growing, ouer that you ≈øhould doe if you ≈øowed it in the next Spring.</p>
                  <p>If there remaine any woolline≈ø≈øe in the ≈øeede, pull it in ≈øunder as well as you can, and then ≈øowe your ≈øeede rea≈øonable thin, and not too thicke, vpon a plaine ≈ømooth bed of fine earth, or rather in pots or tubbes, and after the ≈øowing, ≈øift or gently ≈øtraw ouer them ≈øome fine good fre≈øh mould, about one fingers thickne≈ø≈øe at the mo≈øt for the fir≈øt time: And about a moneth after their fir≈øt ≈øpringing vp, ≈øift or ≈øtraw ouer them in like manner another fingers thickne≈ø≈øe of fine earth, and in the meane time if the weather proue dry, you mu≈øt water them gently and often, but not to ouerglut them with moi≈øture; and thus doing, you ≈øhall haue them ≈øpring vp before Winter, and <pb n="213" facs="tcp:15790:113"/> grow pretty ≈øtrong, able to abide the ≈øharpe Winter in their nonage, in v≈øing ≈øome little care to couer them loo≈øely with ≈øome fearne, or fur≈øe, or beane hame, or ≈øtraw, or any ≈øuch, which yet mu≈øt not lye clo≈øe vpon them, nor too farre from them neither.</p>
                  <p>The next Spring after the ≈øowing, if you will, but it is better if you ≈øtay vntill Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øt, you may then remoue them, and ≈øet them in order by rowes, with ≈øufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance one from another, where they may abide, vntill you ≈øee what manner of flower each plant will beare, which you may di≈øpo≈øe of according to your minde.</p>
                  <p>Many of them being thus ordered (if your mould be fine, loo≈øe, and fre≈øh, not ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, clayi≈øh, or from a middin) will beare flowers the ≈øecond yeare after the ≈øowing, and mo≈øt or all of them the third yeare, if the place where you ≈øowe them, be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with the ≈ømoake of Brewers, Dyers, or Maultkils, which if it be, then will they neuer thriue well.</p>
                  <p>Thus much haue I thought good to ≈øet downe, to incite ≈øome of our owne Nation to be indu≈øtrious; and to helpe them forward, haue giuen ≈øuch rules of directions, that I doubt not, but they will vpon the tryall and view of the variety, proceede as well in the ≈øowing of Anemones as of Tulipas.</p>

                  <p>The ordinary time to plant Anemones, is mo≈øt commonly in Augu≈øt, which will beare flower ≈øome peraduenture before Winter, but mo≈øt v≈øually in February, March, and Aprill, few or none of them abiding vntill May; but if you will keepe ≈øome roots out of the ground vnplanted, vntill February, March, and Aprill, and plant ≈øome at one time, and ≈øome at another, you ≈øhall haue them beare flower according to their planting, tho≈øe that ≈øhall be planted in February, will flower about the middle or end of May, and ≈øo the re≈øt accordingly after that manner: And thus may you haue the plea≈øure of the≈øe plants out of their naturall ≈øea≈øons, which is not permitted to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed in any other that I know, Nature being not ≈øo prone to bee furthered by art in other things as in this. Yet regard, that in keeping your Anemone rootes out of the ground for this purpo≈øe, you neither keep them too dry, nor yet too moi≈øt, for ≈øprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or rotting; and in planting them, that you ≈øet them not in too open a ≈øunny place, but where they may be ≈øomewhat ≈øhadowed.</p>

The Birds eyes are called of Lobel in Latine,
<hi>Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica Alpina, Sanicula angustifolia,</hi> making a greater and a le≈ø≈øer. Others call them <hi>Sanicula angu≈øtifolia</hi> but generally they are called <hi>Primula veris minor.</hi> I haue (as you ≈øee) placed them with the Cow≈ølips, putting a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Primro≈øes and Cow≈ølips.

<hi>Humilis,</hi> Lowe or Dwarfe Primro≈øes. In Engli≈øh they haue in like manner diuers names, according to ≈øeuerall Countries, as Primro≈øes, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølips, Oxelips, Pal≈øiewort, and Petty Mulleins. The fir≈øt kindes, which are lower then the re≈øt, are generally called by the name of Primro≈øes (as I thinke) throughout England.

Tho≈øe are v≈øually called Oxelips, who≈øe flowers are naked, or bare without huskes to containe them, being not ≈øo ≈øweete as the Cow≈ølip, yet haue they ≈øome little ≈øent, although the Latine name doth make them to haue none. The Franticke, Fanta≈øticke, or Fooli≈øh Cow≈ølip, in ≈øome places is called by Country people, Iacke an Apes on hor≈øe-backe, which is an v≈øuall name with them, giuen to many other plants, as Dai≈øies, Marigolds, &amp;c. if they be ≈øtrange or fanta≈øticall, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the forme from the ordinary kinde of the ≈øingle ones.

Others call it <hi>Buglo≈ø≈øum Hi≈øpanicum,</hi> in Engli≈øh Alkanet, and of ≈øome Orchanet, after the French. Limonium was found by Leonhartus Rauwolfius, neere vnto Iop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, which he ≈øetteth downe in the ≈øecond Chapter of the third booke of his trauayles, and from him fir≈øt knowne to the≈øe parts: I haue, as you ≈øee, referred it to the kindes of Buglo≈ø≈øe, for that the flowers haue ≈øome re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance vnto them, although I know that <hi>Limonium genuinum</hi> is referred to the Beetes.

The la≈øt I haue not yet knowne to growe in England; but no doubt many things doe lye hid, and not ob≈øerued, which in time may bee di≈øcouered, if our Country Gentlemen and women, and others, in their ≈øeuerall places where they dwell, would be more carefull and diligent, and be aduerti≈øed either by them≈øelues, or by others capable and fit to be imployed, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion and time might ≈øerue, to finde out ≈øuch plants as growe in any the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits or limits of their habitations, or in their trauels, as their plea≈øures or affaires leade them. And becau≈øe ignorance is the chiefe cau≈øe of neglect of many rare things, which happen to their view at ≈øometimes, which are not to be ≈øeene againe peraduenture, or not in many yeares after, I would heartily adui≈øe all men of meanes, to be ≈øtirred vp to bend their mindes, and ≈øpend a little more time and trauell in the≈øe delights of herbes and flowers, then they haue formerly done, which are not onely harmle≈ø≈øe, but plea≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in their time, and profitable in their v≈øe.

                  <p>The great Indian Tabacco hath many very large, long, thicke, fat and faire greene leaues, ≈øtanding foreright for the mo≈øt part, and compa≈ø≈øing the ≈øtalkes at the bottome of them, being ≈øomewhat pointed at the end: the ≈øtalke is greene and round, ≈øixe or ≈øeuen foote high at ≈øometimes, and in ≈øome places, in others not pa≈øt three or foure foote high, diuided towards the toppe into many branches, with leaues at euery ioynt, and at the toppes of the branches many flowers, the bottomes hereof are long and hollow, and the toppes plaited or folded before they are open, but being open, are diuided ≈øometimes into foure, or more v≈øually into fiue corners, ≈øomewhat like vnto other of the Bell-flowers, but lying a little flatter open, of a light carnation colour. The ≈øeede is very ≈ømall and browne, contained in round heads, that are clammy while they are greene, and pointed at the end: the roote is great, whiti≈øh, and woody at the head, di≈øper≈øing many long branches, and ≈ømall fibres vnder the ground, whereby it is ≈øtrongly fa≈øtened, but peri≈øheth with our violent fro≈øts in the winter, if it be left abroad in the garden, but if it be hou≈øed, or ≈øafely prouided for again≈øt the fro≈øtes, the rootes will liue, and ≈øpring afre≈øh the next yeare.</p>
                  <p>There is of this kinde another ≈øort, who≈øe leaues are as large and long as the former, but thicker, and of a more dead greene colour, hanging downe to the ground-ward, and ≈øcarce any ≈øtanding forth-right, as the former, vnle≈ø≈øe they bee very young: the flowers of this kinde are almo≈øt whole, without any great ≈øhew of corners at the brims or edges, in all other things there is no difference.</p>

All the≈øe flowers doe open for the mo≈øt part, in the euening, or in the night time, and ≈øo ≈øtand blowne open, vntill the next mornings ≈øun beginne to grow warme vpon them, which then clo≈øe them≈øelues together, all the brims of the flowers ≈øhrinking into the middle of the long necke, much like vnto the blew Bindeweede, which in a manner doth ≈øo clo≈øe vp at the ≈øunnes warme heate: or el≈øe if the day be temperate and milde, without any ≈øunne ≈øhining vpon them, the flowers will not clo≈øe vp for the mo≈øt part of that day, or vntill toward night: after the flowers are pa≈øt, come ≈øeuerall ≈øeedes, that is, but one at a place as the flowers ≈øtood before, of the bigne≈ø≈øe (≈øometimes) of ≈ømall pea≈øe, but not ≈øo round, ≈øtanding within the greene huskes, wherein the flowers ≈øtood before, being a little flat at the toppe, like a crowne or head, and round where it is fa≈øtened in the cup, of a blacke colour when it is ripe, but el≈øe greene all the while it groweth on the ≈øtalke, and being ripe is ≈øoone ≈øhaken downe with the wind, or any other light ≈øhaking: the roote is long and round, greater at the head, and ≈ømaller downwards to the end, like vnto a Reddi≈øh, ≈øpreading into two or three, or more branches, blacki≈øh on the out≈øide and whiti≈øh within.

Take this note al≈øo for the ≈øowing of your ≈øeede, that if you would haue variable flowers, and not all of one colour, you mu≈øt choo≈øe out ≈øuch flowers as be variable while they grow, that you may haue the ≈øeede of them: for if the flowers bee of one entire co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, you ≈øhall haue for the mo≈øt part from tho≈øe ≈øeedes, plants that will bring flowers all of that colour, whether it be white, red or yellow.</p>

<hi>Chamaelaea</hi> and <hi>Thymaelaea</hi> together. Matthiolus maketh it to be <hi>Daphnoides</hi> of Dio≈øcorides; but in my opinion he is therein mi≈øtaken: for all our be≈øt moderne Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe account our

                     <p>The fir≈øt is called of Matthiolus <hi>Lilac,</hi> and by that name is mo≈øt v≈øually called in all parts. It is al≈øo called
<hi>Syringa caerulea,</hi> becau≈øe it commeth nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt vnto tho≈øe woods, which for their pithy ≈øub≈øtance, were made hollow into pipes. It is called of all in Engli≈øh, The blew Pipe tree. It ≈øeemeth likely, that Petrus Bellonius in his third Booke and fiftieth Chapter of his ob≈øeruations (making mention of a ≈øhrubbe that the Turkes haue, with Iuie leaues alwaies greene, bearing blew or violet coloured flowers on a long ≈øtalke, of the bigne≈ø≈øe and fa≈øhion of a Foxe taile, and thereupon called in their language a Foxe taile) doth vnder≈øtand this plant here expre≈ø≈øed. The certainty whereof might ea≈øily be knowne, if any of our Merchants there re≈øiding, would but call for ≈øuch a ≈øhrubbe, by the name of a Foxe taile in the Turki≈øh tongue, and take care to ≈øend a young roote, in a ≈ømall tubbe or basket with earth by Sea, vnto vs here at London, which would be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a very little paines and co≈øt. The ≈øecond and third, as kindes thereof, haue their names in their titles. The fourth is called by Clu≈øius and others,
<hi>Frutex Coronarius;</hi> ≈øome doe call it <hi>Lilac flore albo,</hi> but that name is not proper, in that it doth confound both kindes together. Lobel calleth it <hi>Syringa Italica.</hi> It is now generally called of all
<hi>Syringa alba,</hi> that is in Engli≈øh, The white Pipe tree. Some would haue it to bee <hi>O≈øtrys</hi> of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phra≈øtus, but Clu≈øius hath ≈øufficiently cleared that doubt.

Of the manured kinde wee haue onely one ≈øort (≈øo farre as we know) for it neuer beareth ripe fruit in this our Countrey) which for the beautifull a≈øpect, both of the greene verdure of the leaues, and faire proportion and colour of the flowers, as al≈øo for the raritie, are nour≈øed in ≈øome few of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens that delight in ≈øuch rarities: for in regard of the tenderne≈ø≈øe, there is neede of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care, that is, to plant it again≈øt a brick wall, and defend it conueniently from the ≈øharpene≈ø≈øe of our winters, to giue his Ma≈øter ≈øome plea≈øure in ≈øeeing it beare flowers: And of the double kinde we haue as yet obtained but one ≈øort, although I ≈øhall giue you the knowledge and de≈øcription of another.</p>

                  <p>This white Hy≈ø≈øope is of the ≈øame kinde and ≈ømell with the common Hy≈ø≈øope; but differeth, in that this many times hath diuers leaues, that are wholly of a white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with part of the ≈øtalke al≈øo: others are parted, the one halfe white, the other halfe greene, and ≈øome are wholly greene, or with ≈øome ≈øpots or ≈øtripes of white within the greene, which makes it delightfull to mo≈øt Gentlewomen.</p>

                     <p>The common Hy≈ø≈øope is much v≈øed in all pectorall medicines, to cut fleagme, and to cau≈øe it ea≈øily to be auoided. It is v≈øed of many people in the Country, to be laid vnto cuts or fre≈øh wounds, being brui≈øed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed eyther alone, or with a little Sugar. It is much v≈øed as a ≈øweet herbe, to be in the windowes of an hou≈øe. I finde it much commended again≈øt the Falling Sickne≈ø≈øe, e≈øpecially being made into Pils after this manner: Of Hy≈ø≈øope, Horhound, and Ca≈øtor, of each halfe a dramme, of Peony rootes (the male kinde is onely fit to be v≈øed for this purpo≈øe) two drams, of <hi>A≈ø≈øa faetida</hi> one ≈øcruple: Let them be beaten, and made into pils with the iuyce of Hy≈ø≈øope; which being taken for ≈øeuen dayes together at night going to bed, is held to be effectual to giue much ea≈øe, if not thoroughly to cure tho≈øe that are troubled with that di≈øea≈øe. The v≈øe of Germander ordinarily is as Tyme, Hy≈ø≈øope, and other ≈øuch herbes, to border a knot, whereunto it is often appropriate, and the rather, that it might be cut to ≈øerue (as I ≈øaid) for a ≈øtrewing herbe for the hou≈øe among others.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing giuen you the be≈øt rules and in≈øtructions that I can for your flower Garden, and all the flowers that are fit to furni≈øh it, I now proceede to your herbe garden, which is not of the lea≈øt re≈øpect belonging to any mans hou≈øe, nor vtterly to bee neglected for the many vtilities are to be had from it, both for the Ma≈øters profit and plea≈øure, and the meynies content and nouri≈øhment: all which if I ≈øhould here ≈øet down, I had a large field to wander in, and matter ≈øufficient to entreat of, but this worke permitteth not that libertie: and I thinke there are but few but eyther know it already, or conceiue it ≈øufficiently in their minds. Pa≈ø≈øing therefore no further in ≈øuch di≈øcour≈øes, I come to the matter in hand, which is to ≈øhew you where the fitte≈øt place is for an herbe garden. As before I ≈øhewed you that the beautie of any worthy hou≈øe is much the more commended for the plea≈øant ≈øituation of the garden of flowers, or of plea≈øure, to be in the ≈øight and full pro≈øpect of all the chiefe and choi≈øe≈øt roomes of the hou≈øe; ≈øo contrariwi≈øe, your herbe garden ≈øhould bee on the one or other ≈øide of the hou≈øe, and tho≈øe be≈øt and choy≈øe roomes: for the many different ≈øents that ari≈øe from the herbes, as Cabbages, Onions, &amp;c. are ≈øcarce well plea≈øing to perfume the lodgings of any hou≈øe; and the many ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and breaches as it were of many of the beds thereof, which mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily bee, are al≈øo as little plea≈øant to the ≈øight. But for priuate mens hou≈øes, who mu≈øt like their habitations as they fall vnto them, and cannot haue time or meanes to alter them, they mu≈øt make a vertue of nece≈ø≈øity, and conuert their places to their be≈øt aduantage, by making their profit their chiefe≈øt plea≈øure, and making one place ≈øerue for all v≈øes. The choyce of ground for this Garden, is (as I ≈øaid before) where it is fat, fertill and good, there needeth the le≈ø≈øe labour and co≈øt: and contrariwi≈øe, where it is cold, wet, dry or barren, there mu≈øt bee the more helpes ≈øtill added to keepe it in heart. For this Garden by rea≈øon of the much and continuall ≈øtirring therein, the herbes and rootes drawing out the ≈øub≈øtance of the fertilitie thereof more aboundantly then in the former, mu≈øt be continually holpen with ≈øoyle, or el≈øe few things of goodne≈ø≈øe or worth will come forward therein. The ≈øtable ≈øoyle of hor≈øes is be≈øt and more proper for any colde grounds, for being the hotte≈øt, it will cau≈øe any the ≈øeedes for this Garden to pro≈øper well, and be more forward then in any other ground that is not ≈øo holpen. The ≈øtable ≈øoyle of Cattell is of a colder and moi≈øter nature, and is therefore more proper for <pb n="462" facs="tcp:15790:238"/> the hot ≈øandy or grauelly grounds, and although it bee longer before it bee brought to mould then that of hor≈øes, yet it will outla≈øt it more then twice ≈øo long. Let euery one therefore take according to the nature of the ground ≈øuch helpes as are mo≈øt fit and conuenient, as I haue here and before ≈øhewed. But I doe here ingenuou≈øly confe≈ø≈øe my opinion of the≈øe forcings and helpings of ground, that how≈øoeuer it doth much good to ≈øome particular things, which becau≈øe they delight in heate, and cannot be brought to perfection without it in this our Countrey, which is colder then their naturall from whence they are brought, mu≈øt therfore haue artificiall helpes to forward them; yet for many other things the compo≈øt doth much alter and abate the naturall vigour, and quickene≈ø≈øe of ta≈øte, that is perceiued in them that grow in a naturall fat or ≈øandy ≈øoile that is not ≈øo holpen.</p>

And ≈øome will doe ≈øo with their Cabbages al≈øo, but the be≈øt and mo≈øt fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall way now v≈øed, is to plant them round about the border of your plot or ground whereon you plant Cowcumbers, Pompions, or other things, in that by this meanes ≈øo much ground will be well ≈øaued, and the other things be no whit hindered thereby, which el≈øe a great deale of ground mu≈øt be employed for them apart. So that by this that I haue here ≈øaid, you may perceiue the forme of this Garden is for the mo≈øt part, to bee ≈øtill out of forme and order, in that the continuall taking vp of the herbes and rootes that are ≈øowen and planted, cau≈øeth the beds or parts of this Garden to lye broken, di≈ømembered, and out of the order that at the fir≈øt it was put into. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber herewithall that (as I ≈øaid before) this Garden requireth the continuall helpe of ≈øoyle to be brought into it, in that the plenty of the≈øe manner of herbes and rootes doe ≈øo much wa≈øte the fertilitie and fatne≈ø≈øe of the ground, that without continuall refre≈øhing it would quickly become ≈øo poore and barren, that it would not yeelde the worth of the ≈øeede. The ordinary time to ≈øoyle a Garden, is to bring in manure or dung before Chri≈øtmas, and eyther bury it ≈øome ≈ømall depth, not too deepe, or el≈øe to lay it vpon the ground that the winter fro≈øtes may pierce it, and then turne it ≈øhallow into the ground to ≈øow your ≈øeeds in the Spring.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> How to order diuers Garden herbes, both for their ≈øowing, ≈øpending, and gathering of the ≈øeede.</head>
               <p>OVr chiefe≈øt and greate≈øt Gardiners now adaies, doe ≈øo prouide for them≈øelues euery yeare, that from their owne grounds they gather the ≈øeede of many herbes that they ≈øowe againe: for hauing gained the be≈øt kind of diuers herbes, they will be ≈øtill furni≈øhed with the ≈øame, and be not to ≈øeeke euery yeare for new that oftentimes will not yeelde them halfe the profit that their choyce ≈øeede will: I ≈øay of many herbes, but not of all; for the be≈øt of them all hath not ground ≈øufficient for all ≈øorts, nor will our climate bring ≈øome to that perfection that other forraine doth, and therefore the ≈øeede of ≈øome things are continually brought from beyond Sea vnto vs. And againe although our chiefe Gardiners doe ≈øtill prouide their owne ≈øeede of diuers things from their owne ground, becau≈øe as I ≈øaid it is of the be≈øt kinde, yet you mu≈øt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand al≈øo, that good ≈øtore of the ≈øame ≈øortes of ≈øeeds are brought from beyond the Seas, for that which is gathered in this Land is not ≈øufficient to ≈øerue euery mans v≈øe in the whole Kingdome by many parts; yet ≈øtill it is true, that our Engli≈øh ≈øeede of many things is better then any that commeth from beyond the Seas: as for example, Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øh, Lettice, Carrots, Par≈øneps, Turneps, Cabbages, and Leekes, of all which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to write in this place; for the≈øe are by them ≈øo husbanded, that they doe not ≈øow their owne grounds with any other ≈øeede of the≈øe ≈øorts but their owne: which that you may know the manner how to doe, I will here ≈øet it downe, that euery one may haue the be≈øt directions if they will follow them. Of Reddi≈øh there are two ≈øorts, one more early then the other: they v≈øe therfore to ≈øow their early Reddi≈øh fir≈øt, that they may haue the earlie≈øt profit of them, which is more worth in one fortnight, then in a moneth after. And to effect this they haue ≈øome artificiall helps al≈øo; which are the≈øe: They v≈øe to digge vp a large plot of ground where they intend to ≈øow their ≈øeede a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before or after Chri≈øtmas, ca≈øting it into high balkes or ridges fiue or ≈øixe foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øunder, which they ≈øuffer to lye and take all the extreame fro≈øts in Ianuary to mellow the earth, and when the fro≈øtes are pa≈øt, they then beginne to bring into it good ≈øtore of fre≈øh ≈øtable dung, which they laye neyther too deepe nor too thicke, and couer it with the mould a hand breadth thickne≈ø≈øe aboue the dung, which doth giue ≈øuch a warmth and comfort to what≈øoeuer is ≈øowen thereon, that it forceth it forward much ≈øooner then any other way can doe: And to preuent both the fro≈øtes, and the cold bitter windes which often ≈øpoyle their ≈øeede new ≈øprung vp, they v≈øe to ≈øet great high and large mattes made of reedes, tyed together, and fa≈øtened vnto ≈øtrong ≈øtakes, thru≈øt into the ground to keepe them vp from falling, or being blowne down with the winde; which mattes they place on the North and Ea≈øt ≈øide to breake the force of the≈øe winds, and are ≈øo ≈øure and ≈øafe a defence, that a bricke wall cannot better defend any thing vnder it, then this fence will. In this manner they doe euery yeare to bring forward their ≈øeede to gaine the more by them, and they that will haue Reddi≈øh early, mu≈øt take the ≈øame cour≈øe. The other ≈øort of Reddi≈øh for the mo≈øt part is ≈øowen in Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, a fortnight after the other at the lea≈øt, and likewi≈øe euery moneth after vnto Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, that they may haue young continually. For the blacke Reddi≈øh, although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in many places doe ≈øowe it in the ≈øame time, and in the ≈øame manner that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is ≈øowen, yet the nature thereof is to runne vp to ≈øeede more ≈øpeedily then the other, if it haue ≈øo rich ground to grow vpon, and therefore the be≈øt time to ≈øow it is in Augu≈øt, that ≈øo it may abide all winter, wherein is the chiefe≈øt time for the ≈øpending thereof, and to keepe it vntill the beginning of the next yeare from running vp to ≈øeede the gathering whereof, as al≈øo of the other ≈øort, is all after one manner, that is, to be pulled vp when the pods change whiti≈øh, and then hanged vpon bu≈øhes, pales, or ≈øuch other thing, vntill they bee thorough dry, and then beaten or thra≈øhed out vpon a ≈ømooth plancher, or vpon clothes, as euery ones ≈øtore is, and their conueniencie. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is ≈øowen oftentimes with the early Reddi≈øh, in the ≈øame manner before ≈øaid, that they may haue Lettice likewi≈øe as early as the time of the year will permit them, which <pb n="464" facs="tcp:15790:239"/> they pull vp where they grow too thicke, ≈øpending them fir≈øt, and ≈øo taking, vp from time to time, vntill they ≈øtand two foote in ≈øunder one from another, and beginne to ≈øpindle and ≈øhoote vp for ≈øeede. In this is v≈øed ≈øome arte to make the plants ≈øtrong to giue the better ≈øeede without danger of rotting or ≈øpoyling with the wet, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happeneth to tho≈øe about whom this caution is not ob≈øerued: Before your Lettice is ≈øhot vp, marke out the choy≈øe≈øt and ≈øtronge≈øt plantes which are fitte≈øt to grow for ≈øeede, and from tho≈øe when they are a foote high, ≈øtrippe away with your hand the leaues that grow lowe≈øt vpon the ≈øtalke next the ground, which might rot, ≈øpoyle or hinder them from bearing ≈øo good ≈øeede; which when it is neere to be ripe, the ≈øtalkes mu≈øt be cut off about the middle, and layde vpon mats or clothes in the Sunne, that it may there fully ripen and be gathered; for it would be blowne away with the winde if it ≈øhould be ≈øuffered to abide on the ≈øtalkes long. Par≈øneps mu≈øt be ≈øowen on a deep trenched mellow ground, otherwi≈øe they may run to ≈øeede the fir≈øt yeare, which then are nothing worth: or el≈øe the rootes will be ≈ømall ≈øtaruelings and ≈øhort, and runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many ≈øpires or branches, whereby they will not bee of halfe the worth. Some v≈øe to ≈øow them in Augu≈øt and September, that ≈øo they may bee well growne to ≈øerue to ≈øpend in Lent following, but their be≈øt time is in February, that the Summers growth may make them the fairer and greater. When they runne vp to ≈øeede, you ≈øhall take the principall or middle heades, for tho≈øe carry the Ma≈øter ≈øeede, which is the be≈øt, and will produce the faire≈øt rootes againe. You ≈øhall hardly haue all the ≈øeede ripe at one in≈øtant, for v≈øually the chiefe≈øt heads will be fallen before the other are ripe: you mu≈øt therefore ≈øtill looke them ouer, and cut them as they ripen. Carrots are v≈øually ≈øowen in March and Aprill, and if it chance that ≈øome of them doe runne vp for ≈øeede the ≈øame year, they are to be weeded out, for neyther the ≈øeed nor roots of them are good: You mu≈øt likewi≈øe pull them vp when they are too thicke, if you will haue them grow fair, or for ≈øeed, that they may grow at the lea≈øt three or foure foot in ≈øunder: the ≈øtalkes of Carrots are limber, and fall downe to the ground; they mu≈øt therefore be ≈øu≈øtained by poles layde acro≈ø≈øe on ≈øtalkes thru≈øt into the ground, and tyed to the poles and ≈øtalkes to keepe them vp from rotting or ≈øpoyling vpon the ground: the ≈øeed hereof is not all ripe at once, but mu≈øt be tended and gathered as it ripeneth, and layd to dry in ≈øome dry chamber or floore, and then beaten out with a ≈øtick, and winnowed from the refu≈øe. Turneps are ≈øowne by them≈øelues vpon a good ground in the end of Iuly, and beginning of Augu≈øt, to haue their rootes be≈øt to ≈øpend in winter; for it often happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that tho≈øe ≈øeedes of Turneps that are ≈øowen in the Spring, runne vp to ≈øeede the ≈øame yeare, and then it is not accounted good. Many doe v≈øe to ≈øow Turneps on tho≈øe grounds from whence the ≈øame yeare they haue taken off Reddi≈øh and Lettice, to make the greater profit of the ground, by hauing two crops of increa≈øe in one yeare. The ≈øtalkes of Turneps will bend downe to the ground, as Carrots doe, but yet mu≈øt not be bound or ordered in that manner, but ≈øuffered to grow without ≈øtaking or binding, ≈øo as they grow of ≈øome good di≈øtance in ≈øunder: when the ≈øeede beginneth to grow ripe, be very carefull to pre≈øerue it from the birds, which will be mo≈øt bu≈øie to deuour them. You ≈øhall vnder≈øtand likewi≈øe that many doe account the be≈øt way to haue the faire≈øt and mo≈øt principall ≈øeede from all the≈øe fore-recited herbes, that after they are ≈øowen, and ri≈øen to a rea≈øonable growth, they be tran≈øplanted into fre≈øh ground. Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages al≈øo are not only ≈øowen for the v≈øe of their heads to ≈øpend for meat, but to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ≈øeede likewi≈øe, which how≈øoeuer ≈øome haue endeauoured to doe, yet few haue gained good ≈øeede, becau≈øe our ≈øharpe hard fro≈øtes in winter haue ≈øpoyled and rotted their ≈øtockes they pre≈øerued for the purpo≈øe; but others haue found out a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a more ≈øure way, which is, to take vp your ≈øtocks that are fitte≈øt to be pre≈øerued, and bring them into the hou≈øe, and there wrap them eyther in clothes, or other things to defend them from the cold, and hang them vp in a dry place, vntill the beginning of March following, then planting them in the ground, and a little defend them at the fir≈øt with ≈øtraw ca≈øt ouer them from the cold nights, thereby you may be ≈øure to haue perfect good ≈øeede, if your kinde be of the be≈øt: Sowe your ≈øeed in the moneths of February or March, and tran≈øplant them in May where they may ≈øtand to grow for your v≈øe, but be carefull to kill the wormes or Caterpillers that el≈øe will deuoure all your leaues, and be carefull al≈øo that none of the leaues bee broken in the planting, or otherwi≈øe rubbed, for that oftentimes hindereth the well clo≈øing of them. Leekes are
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:15790:239"/> for the mo≈øt part wholly nour≈øed vp from the ≈øeede that is here gathered; and becau≈øe there is not ≈øo much ≈øtore of them either ≈øowne or ≈øpent, as there is of Onions by the twentieth part, we are ≈øtill the more carefull to be prouided from our owne labours; yet there be diuers Gardiners in this Kingdome, that doe gather ≈øome ≈ømall quantity of Onion ≈øeede al≈øo for their owne or their priuate friends ≈øpending. The ≈øowing of them both is much about one time and manner, yet mo≈øt v≈øually Leeks are ≈øowne later then Onions, and both before the end of March at the furthe≈øt; yet ≈øome ≈øowe Onions from the end of Iuly to the beginning of September, for their Winter proui≈øion. Tho≈øe that are ≈øowne in the Spring, are to be taken vp and tran≈øplanted on a fre≈øh bed prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the purpo≈øe, or el≈øe they will hardly abide a Winter; but hauing taken roote before Winter, they will beare good ≈øeede in the Summer following: You mu≈øt ≈øtake both your Leekes and your Onion beds, and with poles laid a cro≈ø≈øe, binde your lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple headed ≈øtalkes vnto them, on high as well as belowe, or el≈øe the winde and their owne weight will beare them downe to the ground, and ≈øpoile your ≈øeede. You mu≈øt thinne them, that is, pull vp continually after they are fir≈øt ≈øprung vp tho≈øe that growe too thicke, as you doe with all the other herbes before ≈øpoken of, that they may haue the more roome to thriue. Of all the≈øe herbes and rootes before ≈øpoken of, you mu≈øt take the likelie≈øt and faire≈øt to keepe for your ≈øeede; for if you ≈øhould not take the be≈øt, what hope of good ≈øeede can you expect? The time for the ≈øpending of the≈øe herbes and rootes, not particularly mentioned, is vntill they begin to runne vp for ≈øeede, or vntill they are to be tran≈øplanted for ≈øeede, or el≈øe vntill Winter, while they are good, as euery one ≈øhall ≈øee cau≈øe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> How to order Artichokes, Melons, Cowcumbers, and Pompions.</head>
               <p>THere are certaine other herbes to be ≈øpoken of, which are wholly nour≈øed vp for their fruit ≈øake, of whom I ≈øhall not need to ≈øay much, being they are ≈øo frequent in euery place. Artichokes being planted of faire and large ≈ølips, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the roote in September and October (yet not too late) will mo≈øt of them beare fruit the next yeare, ≈øo that they be planted in well dunged ground, and the earth rai≈øed vp like vnto an Anthill round about each roote, to defend them the better from the extreame fro≈øts in Winter. Others plant ≈ølips in March and Aprill, or ≈øooner, but although ≈øome of them will beare fruit the ≈øame yeare, yet all will not. And indeede many doe rather choo≈øe to plant in the ≈øpring then in the fall, for that oftentimes an extreame hard Winter following the new ≈øetting of ≈ølips, when they haue not taken ≈øufficient heart and roote in the ground, doth vtterly pierce and peri≈øh them, when as they that are ≈øet in the Spring haue the whole Summers growth, to make them ≈øtrong before they feele any ≈øharpe fro≈øts, which by that time they are the better able to beare. Muske Melons haue beene begun to bee nour≈øed vp but of late dayes in this Land, wherein although many haue tryed and endeauoured to bring them to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet few haue attained vnto it: but tho≈øe rules and orders which the be≈øt and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulle≈øt haue v≈øed, I will here ≈øet downe, that who ≈øo will, may haue as good and ripe Melons as any other in this Land. The fir≈øt thing you are to looke vnto, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide you a peece of ground fit for the purpo≈øe, which is either a ≈øloping or ≈øheluing banke, lying open and oppo≈øite to the South Sunne, or ≈øome other fit place not ≈øhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and this ground al≈øo you mu≈øt ≈øo prepare, that all the art you can v≈øe about it to make it rich is little enough; and therefore you mu≈øt rai≈øe it with meere ≈øtable ≈øoyle, thorough rotten &amp; well turned vp, that it may be at the lea≈øt three foote deepe thereof, which you mu≈øt ca≈øt al≈øo into high beds or balkes, with deepe trenches or furrowes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, ≈øo as the ridges may be at the lea≈øt a foot and a halfe higher then the furrowes; for otherwi≈øe it is not po≈ø≈øible to haue good Melons growe ripe. The choi≈øe of your ≈øeede al≈øo is another thing of e≈øpeciall regard, and the be≈øt is held to be Spani≈øh, and not French, which hauing once gained, be ≈øure to haue ≈øtill of the ≈øame while they la≈øt <pb n="466" facs="tcp:15790:240"/> good, that you may haue the ≈øeede of your owne ripe Melons from them that haue eaten them, or ≈øaue ≈øome of the be≈øt your ≈øelfe for the purpo≈øe. I ≈øay while they la≈øt good; for many are of opinion, that no ≈øeede of Muske Melons gathered in England, will endure good to ≈øowe againe here aboue the third yeare, but ≈øtill they mu≈øt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed from whence you had your choi≈øe≈øt before. Then hauing prepared a hot bed of dung in Aprill, ≈øet your ≈øeedes therein to rai≈øe them vp, and couer them, and order them with as great care or greater then Cowcumbers, &amp;c. are v≈øed, that when they are ready, they may be tran≈øplanted vpon the beds or balkes of that ground you had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared for them, and ≈øet them at the lea≈øt two yards in ≈øunder, euery one as it were in a hole, with a circle of dung about them, which vpon the ≈øetting being wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with water that hath ≈øtood in the Sunne a day or two, and ≈øo as often as neede is to water, couer them with ≈øtrawe (≈øome v≈øe great hollow gla≈ø≈øes like vnto bell heads) or ≈øome ≈øuch other things, to defend them both from the cold euenings or dayes, and the heate of the Sunne, while they are young and new planted. There are ≈øome that take vpon them great skill, that mi≈ølike of the rai≈øing vp of Melons, as they doe al≈øo of Cowcumbers, on a hot bed of hor≈øe dung, but will put two or three ≈øeedes in a place in the very ground where they ≈øhall ≈øtand and growe, and thinke without that former manner of forcing them forwards, that this their manner of planting will bring them on fa≈øt and ≈øure enough, in that they will plucke away ≈øome of the wor≈øt and weake≈øt, if too many ri≈øe vp together in a place; but let them know for certaine, that how≈øoeuer for Cowcumbers their purpo≈øe and order may doe rea≈øonable well, where the ground is rich and good, and where they ≈øtriue not to haue them ≈øo early, as they that v≈øe the other way, for Muske Melons, which are a more tender fruit, requiring greater care and trouble in the nour≈øing, and greater and ≈øtronger heate for the ripening, they mu≈øt in our cold climate haue all the art v≈øed vnto them that may be, to bring them on the more early, and haue the more comfort of the Sunne to ripen them kindly, or el≈øe they will not bee worth the labour and ground. After you haue planted them as afore≈øaid, ≈øome of good skill doe adui≈øe, that you be carefull in any dry ≈øea≈øon, to giue them wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter twice or thrice euery weeke while they are young, but more afterward when they are more growne, and that in the morning e≈øpecially, yea and when the fruit is growne ≈øomewhat great, to water the fruit it ≈øelfe with a watering pot in the heate of the day, is of ≈øo good effect, that it ripeneth them much fa≈øter, and will giue them the better ta≈øte and ≈ømell, as they ≈øay. To take likewi≈øe the fruit, and gather it at the full time of his ripene≈ø≈øe is no ≈ømall art; for if it be gathered before his due time to be pre≈øently eaten, it will be hard and greene, and not eate kindly; and likewi≈øe if it be ≈øuffered too long, the whole goodne≈ø≈øe will be lo≈øt: You ≈øhall therefore know, that it is full time to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them to ≈øpend pre≈øently, when they begin to looke a little yellowi≈øh on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide, and doe ≈ømell full and ≈øtrong; but if you be to ≈øend them farre off, or keepe them long vpon any occa≈øion, you ≈øhall then gather them ≈øo much the earlier, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the time of the carriage and ≈øpending, they may ripen in the lying, being kept dry, and couered with woollen clothes: When you cut one to eate, you ≈øhall know it to be ripe and good, if the ≈øeede and pulpe about them in the middle be very wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh, and will ea≈øily be ≈øeparated from the meate, and likewi≈øe if the meate looke yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and be mellow, and not hard or greene, and ta≈øte full and plea≈øant, and not wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh: The v≈øuall manner to eate them is with pepper and ≈øalt, being pared and ≈øliced, and to drowne them in wine, for feare of doing more harme. Cowcumbers and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, after they are nour≈øed vp in the bed of hot dung, are to be ≈øeuerally tran≈øplanted, each of them on a large plot of ground, a good di≈øtance in ≈øunder: but the Pompions more, becau≈øe their branches take vp a great deale more ground, &amp; be≈øides, will require a great deale more watering, becau≈øe the fruit is greater. And thus haue you the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of tho≈øe fruits which are of much e≈øteeme, e≈øpecially the two former, with all the better ≈øort of per≈øons; and the third kinde is not wholly refu≈øed of any, although it ≈øerueth mo≈øt vually for the meaner and poorer ≈øort of people, after the fir≈øt early ripe are ≈øpent.</p>

               <p>Mints are to bee ≈øet with their rootes in ≈øome by-place, for that their rootes doe creepe ≈øo farre vnder ground, that they quickly fill vp the places neare adioyning, if they be not puld vp.</p>
               <p>Clarie is to be fowne, and ≈øeedeth and dyeth the next yeare, the herbe is ≈øtrong, and therefore a little thereof is ≈øufficient.</p>
               <p>Nep is ≈øowne, and dyeth often after ≈øeeding, few doe v≈øe it, and that but a little at a time: both it and Clarie are more v≈øed in Tan≈øies then in Broths.</p>
               <p>Co≈øtmarie is to be ≈øet of rootes, the leaues are v≈øed with ≈øome in their Broths, but with more in their Ale.</p>
               <p>Pot Marierome is ≈øet of rootes, being ≈øeparated in ≈øunder.</p>

               <p>Par≈øley is a common herbe, and is ≈øowne of ≈øeede, it ≈øeedeth the next yeare and dyeth: the rootes are more v≈øed in broths then the leaues, and the leaues almo≈øt with all ≈øorts of meates.</p>
               <p>Fennell is ≈øowne of ≈øeede, and abideth many yeares yeelding ≈øeede: the rootes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo are v≈øed in broths, and the leaues more ≈øeldome, yet ≈øerue to trimme vp many fi≈øh meates.</p>
               <p>Borage is ≈øowne of ≈øeede, and dyeth the next yeare after, yet once being ≈øuffered to ≈øeede in a Garden, will ≈øtill come of it owne ≈øhedding.</p>

               <p>Blites are v≈øed but in ≈øome places; for there is a generall opinion held of them, that they are naught for the eyes: they are ≈øowne euery yeare of ≈øeede.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The manner and ordering of many ≈øorts of herbes and rootes for Sallets.</head>
               <p>IF I ≈øhould ≈øet downe all the ≈øorts of herbes that are v≈øually gathered for Sallets, I ≈øhould not onely ≈øpeake of Garden herbes, but of many herbes, &amp;c. that growe wilde in the fields, or el≈øe be but weedes in a Garden; for the v≈øuall manner with many, is to take the young buds and leaues of euery thing almo≈øt that groweth, as well in the Garden as in the Fields, and put them all together, that the ta≈øte of the one may amend the relli≈øh of the other: But I will only ≈øhew you tho≈øe that are ≈øown or planted in gardens for that purpo≈øe. A≈øparagus is a principall &amp; delectable Sallet herbe, who≈øe young ≈øhootes when they are a good handfull high aboue the ground, are cut an inch within the ground, which being boyled, are eaten with a little vinegar and butter, as a Sallet of great delight. Their ordering with the be≈øt Gardiners is on this wi≈øe: When you haue prouided ≈øeede of the be≈øt kinde, you mu≈øt ≈øowe it either before Chri≈øtmas, as mo≈øt doe, or before the end of February; the later you ≈øowe, the later and the more hardly will they ≈øpring: after they are growne vp, they are to be tran≈øplanted in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne on a bed well trenched in with dung; for el≈øe they will not bee worth your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ≈øet about a foote di≈øtance in ≈øunder, and looke that the more carefull you are in the replanting of them, the better they will thriue, and the ≈øooner great: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fiue or ≈øix yeares ≈øtanding they v≈øually doe decay; and therefore they that ≈øtriue to haue continually faire and great heads, doe from ≈øeede rai≈øe vp young for their ≈øtore. You mu≈øt likewi≈øe ≈øee that you cut not your heads or young ≈øhoote too nigh, or too much, that is, to take away too many heads from a roote, but to leaue a ≈øufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vncut, otherwi≈øe it will kill the heart of your rootes the ≈øooner, cau≈øing them to dye, or to giue very ≈ømall heads or ≈øhootes; for you may well con≈øider with your ≈øelfe, that if the roote haue not head enough left it aboue the ground to ≈øhoote greene this yeare, it will not, nor cannot pro≈øper vnder ground to giue encrea≈øe the next yeare. The ordering of Lettice I haue ≈øpoken of before, and ≈øhall not neede here to repeate what hath beene already ≈øaid, but referre you thereunto for the ≈øowing, planting, &amp;c. onely I will here ≈øhew you the manner of ordering them for Sallets. There are ≈øome ≈øorts of Lettice that growe very great, and clo≈øe their heads, which are called Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:15790:241"/> Lettice, both ordinary and extraordinary, and there are other ≈øorts of great Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that are open, and clo≈øe not, or cabbage not at all, which yet are of an excellent kinde, if they be v≈øed after that e≈øpeciall manner is fit for them, which is, That when they are planted (for after they are ≈øowne, they mu≈øt be tran≈øplanted) of a rea≈øonable di≈øtance in ≈øunder, and growne to be of ≈øome bigne≈ø≈øe, euery one of them mu≈øt bee tyed together with ba≈øt or thread toward the toppes of the leaues, that by this meanes all the inner leaues may growe whiti≈øh, which then are to be cut vp and v≈øed: for the keeping of the leaues clo≈øe doth make them ta≈øte delicately, and to bee very tender. And the≈øe ≈øorts of Lettice for the mo≈øt part are ≈øpent after Summer is pa≈øt, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lettice are not to be had. Lambes Lettice or Corne Sallet is an herbe, which abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all Winter, is the fir≈øt Sallet herbe of the yeare that is v≈øed before any ordinarie Lettice is ready; it is therefore v≈øually ≈øowne in Augu≈øt, when the ≈øeede thereof is ripe. Pur≈ølane is a Summer Sallet herbe, and is to be ≈øowne in the Spring, yet ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what late, becau≈øe it is tender, and ioyeth in warmth; and therefore diuers haue ≈øowne it vpon tho≈øe beddes of dung, whereon they nour≈øed vp their Cowcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, &amp;c. after they are taken away, which being well and often watered, hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Sallet vntill the end of the yeare. Spinach is ≈øowne in the Spring, of all for the mo≈øt part that v≈øe it, but yet if it be ≈øowne in Summer it will abide greene all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then ≈øeedeth quickly: it is a Sallet that hath little or no ta≈øte at all therein, like as Lettice and Pur≈ølane; and therefore Cookes know how to make many a good di≈øh of meate with it, by putting Sugar and Spice thereto. Coleworts are of diuers kinds, and although ≈øome of them are wholly ≈øpent among the poorer ≈øort of people, yet ≈øome kindes of them may be dre≈ø≈øed and ordered as may delight a curious palate, which is, that being boyled tender, the middle ribs are taken cold, and laid in di≈øhes, and vinegar and oyle poured thereon, and ≈øo eaten. Coleflowers are to be had in this Countrey but very ≈øeldome, for that it is hard to meete with good ≈øeede: it mu≈øt bee ≈øowne on beds of dung to force it forward, or el≈øe it would peri≈øh with the fro≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had giuen his head of flowers, and tran≈øplanted into verie good and rich ground, le≈øt you lo≈øe the benefit of your labours. Endiue is of two ≈øorts, the ordinary, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that hath the edges of the leaues curld or crumpled; it is to be whited, to make it the more dainty Sallet, which is v≈øually done in this manner: After they are grown to ≈øome rea≈øonable greatne≈ø≈øe (but in any ca≈øe before they ≈øhoote forth a ≈øtalke in the mid≈øt for ≈øeede) they are to be taken vp, and the rootes being cut away, lay them to dry or wither for three or foure houres, and then bury them in ≈øand, ≈øo as none of them lye one vpon another, or if you can, one to touch another, which by this meanes will change whiti≈øh, and thereby become verie tender, and is a Sallet both for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne and Winter. Succorie is v≈øed by ≈øome in the ≈øame manner, but becau≈øe it is more bitter then Endiue, it is not ≈øo generally v≈øed, or rather v≈øed but of a verie few: and whereas Endiue will ≈øeede the ≈øame yeare it is ≈øowne, and then dye, Succorie abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth manie yeares, the bitterne≈ø≈øe thereof cau≈øing it to be more Phy≈øicall to open ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions; and therefore the flowers pickled vp, as diuers other flowers are v≈øed to be now adaies, make a delicate Sallet at all times when there is occa≈øion to v≈øe them. Of red Beetes, the rootes are onely v≈øed both boyled and eaten cold with vinegar and oyle, and is al≈øo v≈øed to trimme vp or garni≈øh forth manie ≈øorts of di≈øhes of meate: the ≈øeede of the be≈øt kinde will not abide good with vs aboue three yeares, but will dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and growe wor≈øe; and therefore tho≈øe that delight therein mu≈øt be curious, to be prouided from beyond Sea, that they may haue ≈øuch as will giue delight. Sorrell is an herbe ≈øo common, and the v≈øe ≈øo well knowne, both for ≈øawce, and to ≈øea≈øon broths and meates for the ≈øound as well as ≈øicke per≈øons, that I ≈øhall not neede to ≈øay anie more thereof. Cheruill is a Sallet herbe of much v≈øe, both with French and Dutch, who doe much more delight in herbes of ≈øtronger ta≈øte then the Engli≈øh doe: it is ≈øowne early, and v≈øed but a while, becau≈øe it quickly runneth vp to ≈øeede. Sweete Cheruill, or as ≈øome call it, Sweete Cis, is ≈øo like in ta≈øte vnto Ani≈øe ≈øeede, that it much delighteth the ta≈øte among other herbes in a Sallet: the ≈øeede is long, thicke, blacke, and cornered, and mu≈øt be ≈øowne in the end of Autumne, that it may lye in the ground all the Winter, and then it will ≈øhoote out in the Spring, or el≈øe if it be ≈øowne in the Spring, it will not ≈øpring vp that yeare vntill the next: the leaues (as I ≈øaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) are v≈øed among other herbes: the rootes likewi≈øe are not onely cordiall, but al≈øo held to be pre≈øeruatiue again≈øt the Plague, either greene, dryed, or pre≈øeru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d <pb n="470" facs="tcp:15790:242"/> with ≈øugar. Rampion rootes are a kinde of Sallet with a great many, being boyled tender, and eaten cold with vinegar and pepper. Cre≈ø≈øes is an herbe of ea≈øie and quick growth, and while it is young eaten eyther alone, or with par≈øley and other herbes: it is of a ≈øtrong ta≈øte to them that are not accu≈øtomed thereunto, but it is much v≈øed of ≈øtrangers. Rocket is of the ≈øame nature and qualitie, but ≈øomewhat ≈øtronger in ta≈øte: they are both ≈øowen in the Spring, and ri≈øe, ≈øeede and dye the ≈øame yeare. Tarragon is an herbe of as ≈øtrong a ta≈øte as eyther Rocket or Cre≈ø≈øes, it abideth and dyeth not euery yeare, nor yet giueth ripe ≈øeede (as far as euer could bee found with vs) any yeare, but maketh ≈øufficient increa≈øe within the ground, ≈øpreading his roots all abroad a great way off. Mu≈øtard is a common ≈øawce both with fi≈øh and fle≈øh, and the ≈øeed thereof (and no part of the plant be≈øides) is well knowne how to be v≈øed being grownded, as euery one I thinke knoweth. The rootes of hor≈øe Radi≈øh likewi≈øe beeing grownd like Mu≈øtard, is v≈øed both of ≈øtrangers and our owne nation, as ≈øawce for fi≈øh. Tan≈øie is of great v≈øe, almo≈øt with all manner of per≈øons in the Spring of the yeare: it is more v≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally planted of the rootes then otherwi≈øe; for in that the rootes ≈øpread far and neere they may be ea≈øily taken away, without any hurt to the re≈øt of the rootes. Burnet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be more v≈øed in wine in the Summer time then any way el≈øe, yet it is likewi≈øe made a ≈øallet herbe with many, to amend the har≈øh or weak relli≈øh of ≈øome other herbs. Skirrets are better to be ≈øowen of the ≈øeed then planted from the roots, and will come on more ≈øpeedily, and be fairer rootes: they are as often eaten cold as a Sallet, being boyled and the pith taken out, as ≈øtewed with butter and eaten warme. Let not Par≈øley and Fenell be forgotten among your other Sallet herbes, wherof I haue ≈øpoken before, and therefore need ≈øay no more of them. The flowers of Marigolds pickt cleane from the heads, and pickled vp again≈øt winter, make an excellent Sallet when no flowers are to be had in a garden. Cloue Gilloflowers likewi≈øe pre≈øerued or pickled vp in the ≈øame manner (which is <hi>≈øtratum ≈øuper ≈øtratum,</hi> a lay of flowers, and then ≈øtrawed ouer with fine dry and poudered Sugar, and ≈øo lay after lay ≈øtrawed ouer, vntill the pot bee full you meane to keepe them in, and after filled vp or couered ouer with vinegar) make a Sallet now adayes in the highe≈øt e≈øteeme with Gentles and Ladies of the greate≈øt note: the planting and ordering of them both is ≈øpoken of ≈øeuerally in their proper places. Goates bearbe that groweth in Gardens only, as well as that which groweth wilde in Medowes, &amp;c. bearing a yellow flower, are v≈øed as a Sallet, the rootes beeing boyled and pared are eaten cold with vinegar, oyle and pepper; or el≈øe ≈øtewed with butter and eaten warme as Skirrets, Par≈øneps &amp;c. And thus haue you here ≈øet downe all tho≈øe mo≈øt v≈øuall Sallets are v≈øed in this Kingdome: I ≈øay the mo≈øt v≈øuall, or that are nour≈øed vp in Gardens; for I know there are ≈øome other wilde herbes and rootes, as Dandelion &amp;c. but they are v≈øed onely of ≈øtrangers, and of tho≈øe who≈øe curio≈øitie ≈øearcheth out the whole worke of nature to ≈øatisfie their de≈øires.</p>

               <p>HAuing thus ≈øhewed you all the herbes that are mo≈øt v≈øually planted in Kitchen Gardens for ordinary v≈øes, let mee al≈øo adde a few other that are al≈øo nour≈øed vp by many in their Gardens, to pre≈øerue health, and helpe to cure ≈øuch ≈ømall di≈øea≈øes as are often within the compa≈ø≈øe of the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens skils, who, to helpe their owne family, and their poore neighbours that are farre remote from Phy≈øitians and Chirurgions, take much paines both to doe good vnto them, and to plant tho≈øe herbes that are conducing to their de≈øires. And although I doe recite ≈øome that are mentioned in other places, yet I thought it meete to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them altogether in one place. Angelica, the garden kinde, is ≈øo good an herbe, that there is no part thereof but is of much v≈øe, and all cordiall and pre≈øeruatiue from infectious or contagious di≈øea≈øes, whether you will di≈øtill the water of the herbe, or pre≈øerue or candie the rootes or the greene ≈øtalkes, or v≈øe the ≈øeede in pouder or in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtillations, or decoctions with other things: it is ≈øowen of ≈øeede, and will abide vntill <pb n="471" facs="tcp:15790:242"/> it giue ≈øeede, and then dyeth. Rue or Herbe grace is a ≈øtrong herbe, yet v≈øed inwardly again≈øt the plague as an Antidote with Figs and Wall-nuts, and helpeth much again≈øt windy bodies: outwardly it is v≈øed to bee layde to the wre≈øtes of the hands, to driue away agues: it is more v≈øually planted of ≈ølips then rai≈øed from ≈øeede, and abideth long if ≈øharpe fro≈øtes kill it not. Dragons being di≈øtilled are held to be good to expell any euill thing from the heart: they are altogether planted of the rootes. Setwall, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian, or Capons tayle, the herbe often, but the roote much better, is v≈øed to prouoke ≈øweating, thereby to expell euill vapours that might annoy the heart: it is only plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the rootes when they are taken vp, and the young replanted. A≈øarabacca, the leaues are often v≈øed to procure vomiting being ≈øtamped, and the ≈øtrained iuice to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle quantitie, put into a draught of ale and drunke, thereby to ea≈øe the ≈øtomacke of many euill and gro≈ø≈øe humours that there lye and offend it; diuers al≈øo take the leaues and rootes a little boyled in wine, with a little ≈øpice added thereunto, to expell both tertian and quartan agues: the rootes of our Engli≈øh growing is more auaileable for the≈øe purpo≈øes then any outlandi≈øh: it is planted by the roote; for I could neuer ≈øee it ≈øpring of ≈øeede. Ma≈øterwort commeth ≈øomewhat neere in propertie vnto Angelica, and be≈øides very effectuall to di≈øper≈øe winde in the bodie, whether of the collicke or otherwi≈øe; as al≈øo very profitable to comfort in all cold cau≈øes: it yeeldeth ≈øeede, but yet is more v≈øually planted from the rootes being parted. Balme is a cordiall herbe both in ≈ømell and ta≈øte, and is wholly v≈øed for tho≈øe purpo≈øes, that is, to comfort the heart being di≈øtilled into water either ≈øimple or compound, or the herbe dryed and v≈øed: it is ≈øet of the rootes being parted, becau≈øe it giueth no ≈øeede that euer I could ob≈øerue. Camomill is a common herbe well knowne, and is planted of the rootes in alleyes, in walkes, and on bankes to ≈øit on, for that the more it is troden on, and pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed downe in dry weather, the clo≈øer it groweth, and the better it will thriue: the v≈øe thereof is very much, both to warme and comfort, and to ea≈øe paines being applyed outwardly after many fa≈øhions: the decoction al≈øo of the flowers prouoketh ≈øweat, and they are much v≈øed again≈øt agues. Featherfew is an herbe of greater v≈øe for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men then for men, to di≈ø≈øolue flatulent or windy humours, which cau≈øeth the paines of the mother: ≈øome v≈øe to take the iuice thereof in drinke for agues: it is as well ≈øowen of the ≈øeede as planted of the rootes.

Maudlin is held to be a principall good herbe to open and clean≈øe the liuer, and for that purpo≈øe is v≈øed many wayes, as in ale, in tan≈øies, and in broths &amp;c. the ≈øeed al≈øo is v≈øed, and ≈øo is the herbe al≈øo ≈øometimes, to kill the wormes in children: it is ≈øowen of the ≈øeede, and planted al≈øo of the ≈øeparated rootes. Ca≈ø≈øidonie is a ≈ømall kinde of Lauender, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering both in forme and qualitie: it is much v≈øed for the head to ea≈øe paines thereof, as al≈øo put among other things to purge melancholicke di≈øea≈øes: it is ≈øowen of ≈øeede, and abideth not a winter vnle≈ø≈øe it bee well defended, and yet hardly giueth ripe ≈øeede againe with vs. Smallage is a great opening herbe, and much more then eyther Par≈øley or Fenell, and the rootes of them all are often v≈øed together in medicines: it is ≈øowen of ≈øeede, and will not bee wanting in a Garden if once you ≈øuffer it to ≈øow it ≈øelfe. Cardus Benedictus, or the Ble≈ø≈øed Thi≈øtle, is much v≈øed in the time of any infection or plague, as al≈øo to expell any euill ≈øymptome from the heart at all other times. It is v≈øed likewi≈øe to be boyled in po≈ø≈øe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tabacco is of two ≈øorts, and both v≈øed to be planted in Gardens, yet the Engli≈øh kinde (as it is called) is more to be found in our Countrey Gardens then the Indian ≈øort: the leaues of both ≈øorts indifferently, that is, of eyther of which is next at hand, being ≈øtamped and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <pb n="472" facs="tcp:15790:243"/> eyther by it ≈øelfe, or with other herbes in oyle or hogs ≈øuet, doe make an excellent ≈øalue for greene wounds, and al≈øo to clen≈øe old vlcers or ≈øores; the iuice of the greene leaues drunke in ale, or a dryed leafe ≈øteeped in wine or ale for a night, and the wine or ale drunke in the morning, prouoketh to ca≈øt, but the dryed leafe much ≈øtronger then the greene: they are ≈øowen of ≈øeede, but the Indian kinde is more tender, and will not abide a winter with vs abroade. Spurge that v≈øually groweth in Gardens, is a violent purger, and therefore it is needfull to be very carefull how it is v≈øed: the ≈øeede is more ordinarily v≈øed then any other part of the plant, which purgeth by vomiting in ≈øome, and both vpwards and downwards in many; the iuice of the herbe, but e≈øpecially the milke thereof, is v≈øed to kill wartes: it is ≈øowen of ≈øeede, and when it doth once ≈øhed it ≈øelfe, it will ≈øtill continue ≈øpringing of the fallen ≈øeede.

Licoris is much v≈øed now adaies to bee planted in great quantitie, euen to fill many acres of ground, whereof ri≈øeth a great deale of profit to tho≈øe that know how to order it, and haue fit grounds for it to thriue in; for euery ground will not be aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious: It will require a very rich, deepe and mellow ground, eyther naturall or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall; but for a priuate hou≈øe where a ≈ømall quantitie will ≈øerue, there needeth not ≈øo much curio≈øitie: it is v≈øually planted of the top heads, when the lower rootes (which are the Licoris that is v≈øed) and the runners are cut from them.

Our common Par≈øley is ≈øo well knowne, that it is almo≈øt needle≈ø≈øe to de≈øcribe it, hauing diuers fre≈øh greene leaues, three alwaies placed together on a ≈øtalke, and ≈ønipt about the edges, and three ≈øtalkes of leaues for the mo≈øt part growing together: the ≈øtalkes growe three or foure foote high or better, bearing ≈øpikie heads of white flowers, which turne into ≈ømall ≈øeede, ≈øomewhat ≈øharpe and hot in ta≈øte: the roote is long and white.</p>
                     <p>Curld Par≈øley hath his leaues curled or crumpled on the edges, and therein is the onely difference from the former.</p>

                     <p>THere are ≈øo many ≈øorts, and ≈øo great diuer≈øitie of Lettice, that I doubt I ≈øhall ≈øcarce be beleeued of a great many. For I doe in this Chapter reckon vp vnto you eleauen or twelue differing ≈øorts; ≈øome of little v≈øe, others of more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more common and vulgar; and ≈øome that are of excellent v≈øe and ≈øeruice, which are more rare, and require more knowledge and care for the ordering of them, as al≈øo for their time of ≈øpending, as ≈øome in the ≈øpring, ≈øome in ≈øummer, others in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne, and ≈øome being whited for the winter. For all the≈øe ≈øorts I ≈øhall not neede ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny de≈øcriptions, but only ≈øhew you which doe cabbage, and which are loo≈øe, which of of them are great or ≈ømall, white, greene or red, and which of them beare white ≈øeeds, and which of them blacke. And la≈øtly I haue thought good to adde another Sallet herbe, which becau≈øe it is called Lambes Lettice of many, or Corne Sallet of others, is put in only to fill vp a number in this Chapter, and that I mu≈øt ≈øpeake of it, and not that I thinke it to be any of the kindes of Lettice.</p>
                     <p>All ≈øorts of Lettice, after a while that they haue clo≈øed them≈øelues, if they bee of the Cabbage kindes, or otherwi≈øe being loo≈øe, and neuer clo≈øing, ≈øend forth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the middle of their leaues a round ≈øtalke (in ≈øome greater, in others le≈ø≈øer, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their kinde) full of leaues like vnto the lower, branching at the toppe into ≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts, whereon grow diuers ≈ømall ≈øtar-like flowers, of a pale yellowi≈øh colour; after which come ≈øeede, eyther white or blacki≈øh, as the plant yeeldeth, whereat hangeth ≈øome ≈ømall peece of a cottony doune, wherewith the whole head is ≈øtored, and is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the winde, if it be not gathered in time: the roote is ≈øomewhat long and white, with ≈øome fibres at it, and peri≈øheth quickely after the ≈øeede is ripe.</p>
                     <p>The Romane red Lettice is the be≈øt and greate≈øt of all the re≈øt. For Iohn Trade≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cante that fir≈øt, as I thinke, brought it into England, and ≈øowed it, did write vnto mee, that after one of them had been bound and whited, when the refu≈øe was cut away, the re≈øt weighed ≈øeuenteene ounces: this hath blacke ≈øeede.</p>
                     <p>The white Romane Lettice is like vnto it, hauing long leaues like a Tea≈øell, it is in goodne≈ø≈øe next vnto the red, but mu≈øt be whited, that it may eate kindly: the ≈øeede hereof is white.</p>
                     <p>The Virginia Lettice hath ≈øingle and very broade reddi≈øh leaues, and is not of any great regard, and therefore is kept but of a few: it beareth blacke ≈øeede.</p>
                     <p>The common Lumbard Lettice that is loo≈øe, and another kinde thereof that doth ≈øomewhat cabbage, haue both white ≈øeedes.</p>
                     <p>The Venice Lettice is an excellent Cabbage Lettice, and is be≈øt to bee ≈øowen after Mid≈øummer for lateward Lettice; they be ≈øometimes as great as the crowne of a mans hatt: the ≈øeede hereof is white, and groweth to be of a meane height.</p>
                     <p>Our common Cabbage Lettice is well known, and beareth blacke ≈øeede.</p>
                     <p>The curld Lettice which is open, and differeth but little from Endiue, beareth black ≈øeede.</p>
                     <p>Another ≈øort of curld Lettice doth cabbage, and is called Flanders Cropers, or Cropers of Bruges; this groweth lowe≈øt, and hath the ≈ømalle≈øt head, but very hard and round, and white while it groweth: the ≈øeed is blacke.</p>
                     <p>A kinde of Romane Lettice is of a darke green colour, growing as low as the Venice Lettice, and is an excellent kinde, bearing blacke ≈øeede.</p>
                     <p>And la≈øtly our winter Lettice is wonderfull hardy to endure our cold: It is but ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and mu≈øt be ≈øowen at Michaelmas, but will be very good, before any of the other good ≈øorts ≈øowen in the Spring, will be ready to be v≈øed, and beareth white ≈øeed.</p>
                     <p>To in≈øtruct a nouice (for I teach not a Gardiner of knowledge) how to gather his ≈øeede that it may be good, is in this manner: Let him marke out tho≈øe plants that hee meaneth ≈øhall run vp for ≈øeede, which mu≈øt be the mo≈øt likely; &amp; after they haue begun to ≈øhoote forth ≈øtalkes, ≈øtrip away the lower leaues, for two or three hands breadth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ground, that thereby in taking away the lowe≈øt leaues, the ≈øtalke doe not rot, nor the ≈øeed be hindered in the ripening.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="499" facs="tcp:15790:256"/>There are two manner of wayes to whiten Lettice to make them eate the more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: the one is by ray≈øing vp earth like moale hils, round about the plants while they are growing, which will make them grow white: the other is by tying vp all the loo≈øe leaues round together while it groweth, that ≈øo the clo≈øe tying may make it grow white, and thereby be the more tender.</p>
                     <p>Lambes Lettice or Corne Sallet is a ≈ømall plant while it is young, growing clo≈øe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, with many whiti≈øh greene, long and narrow, round pointed leaues, all the winter, and in the beginning of the ≈øpring (if it bee ≈øowen in autumne, as it is v≈øuall to ≈øerue for an early ≈øallet) ri≈øeth vp with ≈ømall round ≈øtalkes, with two leaues at euery ioynt, branching forth at the toppe, and bearing tufts of ≈ømall bleake blew flowers, which turne into ≈ømall round whiti≈øh ≈øeede: the roote is ≈ømall and long, with ≈øome ≈ømall threds hanging thereat: the whole plant is of a wateri≈øh ta≈øte, almo≈øt in≈øipide.</p>

                     <p>THere are diuers ≈øorts of Turneps, as white, yellow, and red: the white are the mo≈øt common, and they are of two kinds, the one much ≈øweeter then the other.</p>
                     <p>The yellow and the red are more rare, and nour≈øed vp only by tho≈øe that are curious: as al≈øo the Navewe, which is ≈øeene but with very few.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="509" facs="tcp:15790:261"/>The ordinary Garden Turnep hath many large, and long rough greene leaues, with deepe and vneuen ga≈øhes on both ≈øides of them: the ≈øtalke ri≈øeth vp among the leaues about two foote high, ≈øpread at the toppe into many branches, bearing theron yellow flowers, which turne into long pods, with blacki≈øh round ≈øeede in them: the roote is round and white, ≈øome greater, ≈øome ≈ømaller; the be≈øt kinde is knowne to be flat, with a ≈ømall pigges tale-like roote vnderneath it; the wor≈øer kinde which is more common in many places of this land, both North and We≈øt, is round, and not flat, with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pigges tayle-like roote vnderneath.</p>
                     <p>The yellow kinde doth often grow very great, it is hardly di≈øcerned from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary kinde while it groweth, but by the greatne≈ø≈øe and ≈øpreading of the leaues beeing boyled, the roote changeth more yellow, ≈øomewhat neare the colour of a Carrot.</p>
                     <p>The red Turnep groweth v≈øually greater then any of the other, e≈øpecially in a good ground, being of a faire red colour on the out≈øide, but being pared, as white as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the in≈øide. This, as Matthiolus ≈øaith, doth grow in the Countrey of Anania, where hee hath ≈øeene an infinite number of them that haue waighed fifty pound a peece, and in ≈øome places hee ≈øaith, a hundred pound a peece, both which we would thinke to be incredible, but that we ≈øee the kind is greatly giuen to grow, and in warme Countries they may ≈øo thriue, that the bulke or bigne≈ø≈øe of the roote may ≈øo farre pa≈ø≈øe the growth of our Countrey, as that it may ri≈øe to that quantity aboue ≈øpecified.</p>
                     <p>The Navew gentle is of two kindes, a ≈ømaller and a greater; the ≈ømaller is v≈øually called in France, <hi>Navean de Cane,</hi> the roote is ≈øomewhat long with the roundne≈ø≈øe; this kinde is twice as bigge as a mans thumbe, and many of them le≈ø≈øe: The other is long and great, almo≈øt as big as the ≈øhort Carrot, but for the mo≈øt part of an vneuen length, and roundne≈ø≈øe vnto the very end, where it ≈øpreadeth into diuers ≈ømall long fibres: neyther of them doth differ much from the Turnep, in leafe, flower or ≈øeed.</p>

                     <p>THere are two principall kindes of Garden Raddi≈øh, the one is blacki≈øh on the out≈øide, and the otherwhite; and of both the≈øe there is ≈øome diui≈øion againe, as ≈øhall be ≈øhewed. Dittander and hor≈øe Raddi≈øh be reckoned kinds thereof.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary Raddi≈øh hath long leaues, vneuenly ga≈øhed on both ≈øides, the ≈øtalke ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth vp to the height of three or foure foote, bearing many purpli≈øh flowers at the top, made of foure leaues a peece, which turne into thicke and ≈øhort pods, wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained round ≈øeede, greater then Turnep or Coleworte ≈øeede, and of a pale reddi≈øh colour: the roote is long, white, and of a reddi≈øh purple colour on the out≈øide toward the toppe of it, and of a ≈øharpe biting ta≈øte.</p>
                     <p>There is a ≈ømall kind of Raddi≈øh that commeth earlier then the former, that we haue had out of the low Countries, not differing in any thing el≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The blacke Raddi≈øh I haue had brought me out of the lowe Countries, where they ≈øell them in ≈øome places by the pound, and is accounted with them a rare winter ≈øallet: <pb n="510" facs="tcp:15790:262"/> the roote of the be≈øt kinde is blacki≈øh on the out≈øide (and yet the ≈øeede gathered from ≈øuch an one, hath after the ≈øowing againe, giuen rootes, whereof ≈øome haue beene blacke, but the mo≈øt part white on the out≈øide) and white within, great and round at the head, almo≈øt like a Turnep, but ending ≈øhorter then a Raddi≈øh, and longer then a Turnep, almo≈øt peare-fa≈øhion, of a firmer and harder ≈øub≈øtance then the ordinary Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øh, but no le≈ø≈øe ≈øharpe and biting, and ≈øomewhat ≈øtrong withall; the leaues are ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ≈ømaller, and with deeper ga≈øhes, the flower and ≈øeede are like the former, but ≈ømaller.</p>
                     <p>Another ≈øort of blacke Raddi≈øh is like in leafe and ≈øeede to the former, but the flower is of a lighter purple colour: the roote is longer and ≈ømaller, and changeth al≈øo to bee white as the former doth, ≈øo that I thinke they haue both ri≈øen from one kinde.</p>
                     <p>The Hor≈øe Raddi≈øh is a kinde of wilde Raddi≈øh, but brought into Gardens for the v≈øe of it, and hath great large and long greene leaues, which are not ≈øo much diuided, but dented about the edges: the roote is long and great, much ≈øtronger in ta≈øte then the former, and abideth diuers yeares, ≈øpreading with branches vnder ground.</p>
                     <p>Dittander is likewi≈øe a wilde kinde hereof, hauing long pointed blewi≈øh greene leaues, and a roote that creepeth much vnder ground: I confe≈ø≈øe this might haue bin placed among the herbes, becau≈øe the leaues and not the rootes are v≈øed; but let it pa≈ø≈øe now with the kindes of Raddi≈øh.</p>

                        <p>The blacke Raddi≈øhes are mo≈øt v≈øed in the winter, (yet ≈øome in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and not forc'd grounds, haue their rootes good mo≈øt part of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) and therefore mu≈øt bee ≈øowen after Mid≈øomer; for if they ≈øhould bee ≈øowen earlier, they would pre≈øently runne vp to ≈øtalke and ≈øeed, and ≈øo lo≈øe the benefit of the roote. The Phy≈øicall propertie is, it is often v≈øed in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that helpe to breake the ≈øtone, and to auoyde grauell.</p>
                        <p>The Hor≈øe Raddi≈øh is v≈øed Phy≈øically, very much in Melancholicke, Spleneticke and Scorbuticke di≈øea≈øes. And ≈øome v≈øe to make a kinde of Mu≈øtard with the rootes, and eate it with fi≈øh.</p>

                     <p>THere be likewi≈øe ≈øundry ≈øorts of Leekes, both great and ≈ømall. Leekes are very like vnto Onions, hauing long green hollow-like leaues, flatti≈øh on the one ≈øide, and with a ridge or cre≈øt on the backe ≈øide: if they bee ≈øuffered to grow vncut, then in the ≈øecond or third yeare after the ≈øowing, they will ≈øend forth a round and ≈ølender ≈øtalke, euen quite thoroughout, and not ≈øwollen or bigger in the middle like the Onion, bearing at the toppe a head of purpli≈øh flowers, and blacke ≈øeede after them, very like vnto Onion ≈øeede, that it is hard to di≈øtingui≈øh them: the root is long and white, with a great bu≈øh of fibres hanging at it, which they call the beards.</p>
                     <p>The vn≈øet Leeke hath longer and ≈ølenderer roots then the other, which being tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, groweth thicker and greater.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="513" facs="tcp:15790:263"/>The French Leeke, which is called the Vine Leeke, is the be≈øt of all others.</p>
                     <p>Our common kinde is of two ≈øorts, one greater then another.</p>
                     <p>Another ≈øort encrea≈øeth altogether by the roote, as Garlicke doth.</p>
                     <p>And then Ciues, which are the ≈ømalle≈øt, and encrea≈øe aboundantly only by the root.</p>
                     <p>Some doe account Scalions to be rather a kinde of Onions then Leekes, and call them <hi>Cepa A≈øcalonica,</hi> or
<hi>A≈øcalonitides,</hi> which will quickly ≈øpend it ≈øelfe, if it be ≈øuffered to be vncut; but all Authors affirme, that there is no wilde kinde of Onion, vnle≈ø≈øe they would haue it to be <hi>Gethyum,</hi> whereof Theophra≈øtus maketh mention, ≈øaying, that it hath a long necke (and ≈øo the≈øe Scalions haue) and was al≈øo of ≈øome called <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyllides,</hi> which antiquity accounted to be dedicated to Latona, the mother of Apollo, becau≈øe when ≈øhe was bigge with childe of Apollo, ≈øhe longed for the≈øe Leekes.</p>

                        <head>The V≈øe of Leekes.</head>
                        <p>The old World, as wee finde in Scripture, in the time of the children of I≈øraels being in Egypt, and no doubt long before, fed much vpon Leekes, Onions, and Garlicke boyled with fle≈øh; and the antiquity of the Gentiles relate the ≈øame manner of feeding on them, to be in all Countries the like, which how≈øoeuer our dainty age now refu≈øeth wholly, in all ≈øorts except the poore≈øt; yet Mu≈øcouia and Ru≈ø≈øia v≈øe them, and the Turkes to this day, (as Bellonius writeth) ob≈øerue to haue them among their di≈øhes at their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yea although they be <hi>Ba≈øhas, Cades,</hi> or
<hi>Vaiuodas,</hi> that is to ≈øay, Lords, Iudges, or Gouernours of countries and places. They are v≈øed with vs al≈øo ≈øometimes in Lent to make pottage, and is a great and generall feeding in Wales with the vulgar Gentlemen.</p>
                        <p>Onions boyled or ro≈øted vnder the embers, and mixed with ≈øugar and butter, are good for tho≈øe that are troubled with coughes, ≈øhortne≈ø≈øe of breath, and whee≈øing. An Onion made hollow at the bottome, and ≈øome good Treakle put into it, with a little iuyce of Citrons (or Lemons in the ≈øtead thereof) being well baked together vnder the embers, after the hole is ≈øtopped againe, and then ≈øtrained forth, and giuen to one that hath the plague, is very helpefull, ≈øo as hee be laid to ≈øweate vpon it.</p>
                        <p>Ciues are v≈øed as well to be ≈øhred among other herbes for the pot, as to be put into a Sallet among other herbs, to giue it a quicker relli≈øh.</p>
                        <p>Leekes are held to free the che≈øt and lungs from much corruption and rotten flegme, that ≈øticketh fa≈øt therein, and hard to be auoided, as al≈øo for them that through hoar≈øene≈ø≈øe haue lo≈øt their voice, if they be eyther taken rawe, or boyled with broth of barley, or ≈øome ≈øuch other ≈øupping, fit and conducing thereunto. And baked vnder hot embers is a remedy again≈øt a ≈øurfeit of Mu≈øhromes.</p>
                        <p>The greene blades of Leekes being boyled and applyed warme to the <hi>Hemorrhoides</hi> or piles, when they are ≈øwolne and painfull, giue a great deale of ca≈øe.</p>

                     <p>The white Artichoke is in all things like the red, but that the head is of a whiti≈øh a≈øhe colour, like the leaues, whereas the former is reddi≈øh.</p>
                     <p>We haue al≈øo another, who≈øe head is greene, and very ≈øharpe vpwards, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in many places.</p>
                     <p>Wee haue had al≈øo another kinde in former times that grew as high as any man, and branched into diuers ≈øtalkes, euery one bearing a head thereon, almo≈øt as bigge as the fir≈øt.</p>
                     <p>There is another kinde, called the Muske Artichoke, which groweth like the French kinde, but is much better in ≈øpending, although it haue a le≈ø≈øer bottome.</p>
                     <p>The French Artichoke hath a white head, the ≈øcales whereof ≈øtand ≈øtaring far a≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one from another at the ends, which are ≈øharpe: this is well known by this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that while it is hot after it is boyled, it ≈øwelleth ≈øo ≈øtrong, that one would verily thinke it had bin boyled in ≈øtinking water, which was brought ouer after a great fro≈øte that had well nigh con≈øumed our be≈øt kindes, and are now almo≈øt cleane ca≈øt out again, none being willing to haue it take vp the roome of better.</p>
                     <p>There is a lowe kinde that groweth much about Paris, which the French e≈øteeme more then any other, and is lower then the former French kinde, the head whereof as well as the leaues, is of a fre≈øher greene colour, almo≈øt yellowi≈øh.</p>
                     <p>Then there is the Thi≈øtle Artichoke, which is almo≈øt a wilde kinde, and groweth ≈ømaller, with a more open and prickly head then any of the former.</p>
                     <p>And la≈øtly, the Chardon as they call it, becau≈øe it is almo≈øt of the forme and nature of a Thi≈øtle, or wilde Artichoke. This groweth high, and full of ≈øharpe prickles, of a grayi≈øh colour. Iohn Trade≈øcante a≈ø≈øured mee, hee ≈øaw three acres of Land about Bru≈ø≈øels planted with this kinde, which the owner whited like Endiue, and then ≈øold them in the winter: Wee cannot yet finde the true manner of dre≈ø≈øing them, that our Countrey may take delight therein.</p>
                     <p>All the≈øe kindes are encrea≈øed by ≈ølipping the young ≈øhootes from the root, which being replanted in February, March, or Aprill, haue the ≈øame yeare many times, but the next at the mo≈øt, borne good heads.</p>
                     <p>Wee finde by dayly experience, that our Engli≈øh red Artichoke is in our Countrey the mo≈øt delicate meate of any of the other, and therefore diuers thinking it to bee a ≈øeuerall kinde, haue ≈øent them into Italie, France, and the Lowe Countries, where they haue not abode in their goodne≈ø≈øe aboue two yeare, but that they haue degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; ≈øo that it ≈øeemeth, that our ≈øoyle and climate hath the preheminence to nouri≈øh vp this plant to his highe≈øt excellencie.</p>

                     <p>THe Garden Beane is of two colours, red or blacke, and white, yet both ri≈øe from one; the ≈ømall or fielde Beanes I make no mention of in this place; but the French or Kidney Beane is almo≈øt of infinite ≈øorts and colours: we doe not for all that intend to trouble you in this place, with the knowledge or relation of any more then is fit for a Garden of that nature, that I haue propounded it in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                     <p>Our ordinary Beanes, ≈øeruing for foode for the poorer ≈øort for the mo≈øt part, are planted as well in fieldes as in gardens, becau≈øe the quantity of them that are ≈øpent ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp many acres of land to be planted in, and ri≈øe vp with one, two or three ≈øtalks, according to the fertilitie of the ≈øoyle, being ≈ømooth and ≈øquare, higher then any man oftentimes, whereon are ≈øet at certaine di≈øtances, from the very bottome almo≈øt to the toppe, two long ≈ømooth fle≈øhy and thicke leaues almo≈øt round, one ≈øtanding by another at the end of a ≈ømall foote≈øtalke: betweene the≈øe leaues and the ≈øtalke, come forth diuers flowers, all of them looking one way for the mo≈øt part, which are clo≈øe a little turned vp at the brimmes, white and ≈øpotted with a blacki≈øh ≈øpot in the middle of them, and ≈øomwhat purpli≈øh at the foot or bottome, of the forme almo≈øt of Broome or Pea≈øe flowers, many of which that grow vpward toward the toppe, doe ≈øeldome beare fruit, and therefore are gathered to di≈øtill, and the toppes of the ≈øtalkes cut off, to cau≈øe the re≈øt to thriue the better; after which grow vp long great ≈ømooth greene pods, greater then in any other kinde of Pul≈øe, which grow blacke when they are ripe, and containe within them two, three or foure Beanes, which are ≈øomewhat flat and round, eyther white or reddi≈øh, which being full ripe grow blacki≈øh: the roote hath diuers fibres annexed vnto the maine roote, which dyeth euery yeare.</p>
                     <p>The French or Kidney Beane ri≈øeth vp at the fir≈øt but with one ≈øtalke, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diuideth it ≈øelfe into many armes or branches, euery one of them being ≈øo weak, that without they be ≈øu≈øtained with ≈øtickes or poles, whereon with their winding and cla≈øpers they take hold, they would lye fruitle≈ø≈øe vpon the ground: vpon the≈øe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches grow forth at ≈øeuerall places long foote≈øtalkes, with euery of them three broade, round and pointed greene leaues at the end of them, towards the tops whereof come forth diuers flowers, made like vnto Pea≈øe blo≈ø≈øomes, of the ≈øame colour for the mo≈øt part that the fruit will be of, that is to ≈øay, eyther white, or yellow, or red, or blacki≈øh, or of a deepe purple &amp;c. but white is mo≈øt v≈øuall for our Garden; after which come long and ≈ølender flat pods, ≈øome crooked, and ≈øome ≈øtraight, with a ≈øtring as it were running downe the backe thereof, wherein are contained flatti≈øh round fruit, made to the fa≈øhion of a kidney: the roote is long, and ≈øpreadeth with many fibres annexed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, peri≈øhing euery yeare.</p>

                     <p>THere bee diuers ≈øorts of Melons found out at this day, differing much in the goodne≈ø≈øe of ta≈øte one from another. This Countrey hath not had vntill of late yeares the skill to nour≈øe them vp kindly, but now there are many that are ≈øo well experienced therein, and haue their ground ≈øo well prepared, as that they will not mi≈ø≈øe any yeare, if it be not too extreme vnkindly, to haue many ripe ones in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable time: yet ≈øome will be later then others alwayes.</p>
                     <p>The Melon is certainly a kinde of Cowcumber, it doth ≈øo neare re≈øemble it, both in the manner of his growing, hauing rough trailing branches, rough vneuen leaues, and yellow flowers: after which come the fruit, which is rounder, thicker, bigger, more rugged, and ≈øpotted on the out≈øide then the Cowcumber, of a ru≈ø≈øet colour, and greene vnderneath, which when it groweth full ripe, will change a little yellowi≈øh, being as deepe furrowed and ribbed as they, and be≈øides hauing chaps or rifts in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of the rinde: the inward hard ≈øub≈øtance is yellow, which onely is eaten: the ≈øeede which is bigger, and a little yellower then the Cowcumber, lying in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle onely among the moi≈øter pulpe: the ≈ømell and changing of his colour, fore-≈øhew their ripene≈ø≈øe to them that are experienced: the roote is long, with many fibres at it. The fruit requireth much watering in the hot time of the day, to cau≈øe them to ripen the ≈øooner, as I haue ob≈øerued by diuers of the be≈øt skill therein.</p>

                        <p>Some are called Sugar Melons, others Peare Melons, and others Muske Melons.</p>
                        <p>They haue beene formerly only eaten by great per≈øonages, becau≈øe the fruit was not only delicate but rare; and therfore diuers were brought from France, and ≈øince were nour≈øed vp by the Kings or Noblemens Gardiners onely, to ≈øerue for their Ma≈øters delight: but now diuers others that haue skill and conueniencie of ground for them, doe plant them and make them more common.</p>
                        <p>They paire away the outer rinde, and cut out the inward pulpe where the ≈øeede lyeth, ≈ølice the yellow firme inward rinde or ≈øub≈øtance, &amp; ≈øo eate it with ≈øalt and pepper (and good ≈øtore of wine, or el≈øe it will hardly di≈øge≈øt) for this is firmer, &amp; hath not that moi≈øture in it that the Cowcumbers haue.

                     <p>The white Strawberry differeth not from the red, but in the colour of the fruite, which is whiter then the former when it is thorough ripe, enclining to redne≈ø≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The greene Strawberry likewi≈øe differeth not, but that the fruit is green on all ≈øides when it is ripe, ≈øaue on that ≈øide the Sun lyeth vpon it, and there it is ≈øomewhat red.</p>
                     <p>The Virginia Strawberry carryeth the greate≈øt leafe of any other, except the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian, but ≈øcarce can one Strawberry be ≈øeene ripe among a number of plants; I thinke the rea≈øon thereof to be the want of skill, or indu≈øtry to order it aright. For the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, and all other Strawberries will not beare kindly, if you ≈øuffer them to grow with many ≈øtrings, and therefore they are ≈øtill cut away.</p>
                     <p>There is another very like vnto this, that Iohn Trade≈øcante brought with him from Bru≈ø≈øels long agoe, and in ≈øeuen yeares could neuer ≈øee one berry ripe on all ≈øides, but ≈øtill the better part rotten, although it would euery yeare flower abundantly, and beare very large leaues.</p>
                     <p>The Bohemia Strawberry hath beene with vs but of late dayes, but is the goodlie≈øt and greate≈øt, both for leafe next to the Virginian, and for beauty farre ≈øurpa≈ø≈øing all; for ≈øome of the berries haue beene mea≈øured to bee neere fiue inches about. Ma≈øter Que≈øter the Po≈øtma≈øter fir≈øt brought them ouer into our Country, as I vnder≈øtand, but I know no man ≈øo indu≈øtrious in the carefull planting and bringing them to perfection in that plentifull maner, as Ma≈øter Vincent Sion who dwelt on the Banck ≈øide, neer the old Paris garden ≈øtaires, who from ≈øeuen rootes, as hee affirmed to me, in one yeare and a halfe, planted halfe an acree of ground with the increa≈øe from them, be≈øides tho≈øe he gaue away to his friends, and with him I haue ≈øeene ≈øuch, and of that bigne≈ø≈øe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>
                     <p>One Strawberry more I promi≈øed to ≈øhew you, which although it be a wilde kinde, and of no v≈øe for meate, yet I would not let this di≈øcour≈øe pa≈ø≈øe, without giuing you the knowledge of it. It is in leafe much like vnto the ordinary, but differeth in that the flower, if it haue any, is greene, or rather it beareth a ≈ømall head of greene leaues, many ≈øet thicke together like vnto a double ruffe, in the mid≈øt whereof ≈øtandeth the fruit, which when it is ripe, ≈øheweth to be ≈øoft and ≈øomwhat reddi≈øh, like vnto a Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, but with many ≈ømall harmle≈ø≈øe prickles on them, which may be eaten and chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mouth without any maner of offence, and is ≈øomewhat plea≈øant like a Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry: it is no great bearer, but tho≈øe it doth beare, are ≈øet at the toppes of the ≈øtalks clo≈øe together, plea≈øant to behold, and fit for a Gentlewoman to weare on her arme, &amp;c. as a raritie in ≈øtead of a flower.</p>

                        <p>The berries them≈øelues are often brought to the Table as a reare ≈øeruice, whereunto claret wine, creame or milke is added with ≈øugar, as euery one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; as al≈øo at other times, both with the better and meaner ≈øort, and are a good cooling and plea≈øant di≈øh in the hot Summer ≈øea≈øon.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I haue done in the two former parts of this Treati≈øe, ≈øo I meane to proceede in this; fir≈øt to ≈øet downe the ≈øituation of an Orchard, and then other things in order: And fir≈øt, I hold that an Orchard which is, or ≈øhould bee of ≈øome rea≈øonable large extent, ≈øhould be ≈øo placed, that the hou≈øe ≈øhould haue the Garden of flowers iu≈øt before it open vpon the South, and the Kitchen Garden on the one ≈øide thereof, ≈øhould al≈øo haue the Orchard on the other ≈øide of the Garden of Plea≈øure, for many good rea≈øons: Fir≈øt, for that the fruit trees being grown great and tall, will be a great ≈øhelter from the North and Ea≈øt windes, which may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your chiefe≈øt Garden, and although that your Orchard ≈øtand a little bleake vpon the windes, yet trees rather endure the≈øe ≈øtrong bitter bla≈øts, then other ≈ømaller and more tender ≈øhrubs and herbes can doe. Secondly, if your Orchard ≈øhould ≈øtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde your Garden of flowers more Southward, it would ≈øhadow too much of the Garden, and be≈øides, would ≈øo binde in the North and Ea≈øt, and North and We≈øt windes vpon the Garden, that it would ≈øpoile many tender things therein, and ≈øo much abate the edge of your plea≈øure thereof, that you would willingly wi≈øh to haue no Orchard, rather then that it ≈øhould ≈øo much annoy you by the ≈øo ill ≈øtanding thereof. Thirdly, the falling leaues being ≈øtill blowne with the winde ≈øo aboundantly into the Garden, would either ≈øpoile many things, or haue one daily and continuall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereon, to clean≈øe and ≈øweepe them away. Or el≈øe to auoide the≈øe great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, appoint out an Orchard the farther off, and ≈øet a greater di≈øtance of ground betweene. For the ground or ≈øoile of the Orchard, what I haue ≈øpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former Garden for the bettering of the ≈øeuerall grounds, may very well ≈øerue and be applyed to this purpo≈øe. But ob≈øerue this, that whereas your Gardens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øpoken of may be turned vp, manured, and bettered with ≈øoile if they growe out of heart, your Orchard is not ≈øo ea≈øily done, but mu≈øt abide many yeares without alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and therefore if the ground be barren, or not good, it had the more neede to bee amended, or wholly made good, before you make an Orchard of it; yet ≈øome there be <pb n="536" facs="tcp:15790:275"/> that doe appoint, that where euery tree ≈øhould bee ≈øet, you onely digge that place to make it good: but you mu≈øt know, that the rootes of trees runne further after a little times ≈øtanding, then the fir≈øt compa≈ø≈øe they are ≈øet in; and therefore a little compa≈ø≈øe of ground can maintaine them but a little while, and that when the rootes are runne beyond that ≈ømall compa≈ø≈øe wherein they were fir≈øt ≈øet, and that they are come to the barren or bad ground, they can thriue no better then if they had beene ≈øet in that ground at the fir≈øt, and if you ≈øhould afterwards digge beyond that compa≈ø≈øe, intending to make the ground better further off, you ≈øhould much hurt the ≈øpreading rootes, and put your trees in danger: the ≈øituation of hils in many places is grauelly or chalky, which is not good for trees, becau≈øe they are both too ≈øtonie, and lacke mellow earth, wherein a tree doth mo≈øt ioy and pro≈øper, and want moi≈øture al≈øo (which is the life of all trees) becau≈øe of the quicke de≈øcent of raine to the lower grounds: and be≈øides all the≈øe inconueniences there is one more; your trees planted either on hils or hill ≈øides, are more ≈øubiect to the fury and force of windes to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, then tho≈øe that growe in the lower grounds; for the ≈øtronge≈øt and mo≈øt forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble windes come not v≈øually out of the North Ea≈øt parts, where you prouide be≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but from the South and We≈øt, whence you looke for the be≈øt comfort of the Sunne. To helpe therefore manie of the inconueniences of the hils ≈øides, it were fit to cau≈øe manie leauels to bee made thereon, by rai≈øing the lower grounds with good earth, and ≈øu≈øtaining them with bricke or ≈øtone wals, which although chargeable, will counteruaile your co≈øt, be≈øide the plea≈øure of the walkes, and pro≈øpect of ≈øo worthy a worke. The plaine or leuell grounds as they are the mo≈øt frequent, ≈øo they are the mo≈øt commendable for an Orchard, becau≈øe the moulds or earths are more rich, or may better and ≈øooner be made ≈øo; and therefore the profits are the more may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed from them. A ≈øtiffe clay doth nouri≈øh trees well, by rea≈øon it containeth moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øture; but in regard of the coldne≈ø≈øe thereof, it killeth for the mo≈øt part all tender and early things therein: ≈øea-cole a≈øhes therefore, bucke a≈øhes, ≈øtreete ≈øoyle, chaulke after it hath lyen abroad and been broken with many yeares fro≈øts and raine, and ≈øheepes dung, are the mo≈øt proper and fitte≈øt manure to helpe this kinde of ≈øoyle. The dry ≈øandy ≈øoile, and grauelly ground are on the contrary ≈øide as bad, by rea≈øon of too much heate and lacke of moi≈øture: the dung of kine or cattell in good quantity be≈øtowed thereon, will much helpe them. The amending or bettering of other ≈øorts of grounds is ≈øet down toward the end of the fir≈øt Chapter of the fir≈øt part of this worke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I will referre you, not willing to repeate againe the ≈øame things there ≈øet downe. The be≈øt way to auoide and amend the inconueniences of high, boi≈øterous, and cold windes, is to plant Walnut trees, Elmes, Oakes or A≈øhes, a good di≈øtance without the compa≈ø≈øe of your Orchard, which after they are growne great, will bee a great ≈øafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard thereunto, by breaking the violence of the windes from it. And if the ≈øoyle of your Orchard want moi≈øture, the conueying of the ≈øinke of the hou≈øe, as al≈øo any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draine of water thereinto, if it may be, will much helpe it.</p>

                  <p>ACcording to the ≈øituation of mens grounds, ≈øo mu≈øt the plantation of them of nece≈ø≈øitie be al≈øo; and if the ground be in forme, you ≈øhall haue a formall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard: if otherwi≈øe, it can haue little grace or forme. And indeed in the elder ages there was ≈ømall care or heede taken for the formality; for euery tree for the mo≈øt part was planted without order, euen where the ma≈øter or keeper found a vacant place to plant them in, ≈øo that oftentimes the ill placing of trees without ≈øufficient ≈øpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and negligence in not looking to vphold them, procured more wa≈øte and ≈øpoile of fruit, then any accident of winde or weather could doe. Orchards in mo≈øt places haue not bricke or ≈øtone wals to ≈øecure them, becau≈øe the extent thereof being <pb n="537" facs="tcp:15790:275"/> larger then of a Garden, would require more co≈øt, which euery one cannot vndergoe; and therefore mud wals, or at the be≈øt a quicke ≈øet hedge, is the ordinary and mo≈øt v≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all defence it findeth almo≈øt in all places: but with tho≈øe that are of ability to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe it with bricke or ≈øtone wals, the gaining of ground, and profit of the fruit trees planted there again≈øt, will in ≈øhort time recompen≈øe that charge. If you make a doubt how to be ≈øure that your Orchard wall ≈øhall haue ≈øufficient comfort of the Sunne to ripen the fruits, in regard the trees in the Orchard being ≈øo nigh thereunto, and ≈øo high withall, will ≈øo much ≈øhadow the wall, that nothing will ripen well, becau≈øe it will want the comfort of the Sunne: you may follow this rule and aduice, to remedy tho≈øe inconueniences. Hauing an Orchard containing one acre of ground, two, three, or more, or le≈ø≈øe, walled about, you may ≈øo order it, by leauing a broad and large walke betweene the wall and it, containing twenty or twenty foure foote (or yards if you will) that the wall ≈øhall not be hindered of the Sun, but haue ≈øufficient comfort for your trees, notwith≈øtanding the height of them, the di≈øtance betweene them and the wall being a ≈øufficient ≈øpace for their ≈øhadow to fall into: and by compa≈ø≈øing your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard on the in≈øide with a hedge

And for the Orchard it ≈øelfe, the ordinary manner is to place them without regard of mea≈øure or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as Peares among Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Plums among Cherries promi≈øcuou≈øly; but ≈øome keepe both a di≈øtance and a diui≈øion for euery ≈øort, without intermingling: yet the mo≈øt gracefull Orchard containeth them all, with ≈øome others, ≈øo as they be placed that one doe not hinder or ≈øpoile another; and therefore to de≈øcribe you the modell of an Orchard, both rare for comeline≈ø≈øe in the proportion, and plea≈øing for the profitablene≈ø≈øe in the v≈øe, and al≈øo durable for continuance, regard this figure is here placed for your direction, where you mu≈øt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue, that your trees are here ≈øet in ≈øuch an equall di≈øtance one from another euery way, &amp; as is fitte≈øt for them, that when they are grown great, the greater branches ≈øhall not gall or rubbe one again≈øt another; for which purpo≈øe twenty or ≈øixteene foot is the lea≈øt to be allowed for the di≈øtance euery way of your trees, &amp; being ≈øet in rowes euery one in the middle di≈øtance, will be the mo≈øt gracefull for the plantation, and be≈øides, giue you way ≈øufficient to pa≈ø≈øe through them, to pruine, loppe, or dre≈ø≈øe them, as need ≈øhall require, and may al≈øo bee brought (if you plea≈øe) to that gracefull delight, that euery alley or di≈øtance may be formed like an arch, the branches of either ≈øide meeting to be enterlaced together. Now for the ≈øeuerall ≈øorts of fruit trees that you ≈øhall place in this modell, your be≈øt direction is to ≈øet Dam≈øons, Bulleis, and your taler growing Plums on the out≈øide, and your lower Plums, Cherries, and Apples on the in≈øide, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard, that you place no Peare tree to the Sunward, of any other tree, le≈øt it ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhadow
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:15790:276"/> them: Let your Peare trees therefore be placed behinde, or on the one ≈øide of your lower trees, that they may be as it were a ≈øhelter or defence on the North &amp; Ea≈øt ≈øide.

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of a nour≈øery for trees, both from ≈øowing the kernels, and planting fit ≈øtockes to graft vpon.</head>
                  <p>ALthough I know the greater ≈øort (I meane the Nobility and better part of the Gentrie of this Land) doe not intend to keepe a Nur≈øery, to rai≈øe vp tho≈øe trees that they meane to plant their wals or Orchards withall, but to buy them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready grafted to their hands of them that make their liuing of it: yet becau≈øe many Gentlemen and others are much delighted to be≈øtowe their paines in grafting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, and e≈øteeme their owne labours and handie worke farre aboue other mens: for their incouragement and ≈øatisfaction, I will here ≈øet downe ≈øome conuenient directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to enable them to rai≈øe an Orchard of all ≈øorts of fruits quickly, both by ≈øowing the kernels or ≈øtones of fruit, and by making choi≈øe of the be≈øt ≈øorts of ≈øtockes to graft on: Fir≈øt therefore to begin with Cherries; If you will make a Nur≈øery, wherein you may bee ≈øtored with plenty of ≈øtockes in a little ≈øpace, take what quantitie you thinke good of ordinarie wilde blacke Cherrie ≈øtones, clean≈øed from the berries, and ≈øowe them, or pricke them in one by one on a peece of ground well turned vp, and large enough for the quantitie of ≈øtones you will be≈øtowe thereon, from the mid≈øt of Augu≈øt vnto the end of September, which when they are two or three yeares old, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their growth, you may remoue them, and ≈øet them anew in ≈øome orderly rowes, hauing pruned their tops and their rootes, which at the next yeares growth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the new planting in any good ground, or at the ≈øecond, will be of ≈øufficient big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe to graft vpon in the bud what ≈øorts of Cherries you thinke be≈øt: and it is fitte≈øt to graft them thus young, that pruning your ≈øtockes to rai≈øe them high, you may graft them at fiue or ≈øix foote high, or higher, or lower, as you ≈øhall ≈øee good, and being thus grafted in the bud, will both more ≈øpeedily and ≈øafely bring forward your grafts, and with le≈ø≈øe danger of lo≈øing your ≈øtockes, then by grafting them in the ≈øtocke: for if the bud take not by inoculating the fir≈øt yeare, yet your tree is not lo≈øt, nor put in any hazzard of lo≈ø≈øe; but may be grafted anew the yeare following, if you will, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place thereof, whereas if you graft in the ≈øtocke, and it doe not take, it is a great chance if the ≈øtocke dye not wholly, or at lea≈øt be not ≈øo weakened both in ≈øtrength and height, that it will not bee fit to bee grafted a yeare or two after. In the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as you doe with the blacke, you may deale with the ordinary Engli≈øh red Cherrie ≈øtones, or kernels, but they are not ≈øo apt to growe ≈øo ≈øtraight and high, nor in ≈øo ≈øhort a time as the blacke Cherrie ≈øtones are, and be≈øides are ≈øubiect in time to bring out ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers from the rootes, to the hinderance of the ≈øtockes and grafts, or at the lea≈øt to the deformitie of your Orchard, and more trouble to the Gardiner, to pull or digge them away. Plumme ≈øtones may bee ordered in this manner likewi≈øe, but you mu≈øt make choi≈øe of your Plums; for although euery Plumme is not ≈øo fit for this purpo≈øe, as the white Peare Plumme, becau≈øe it groweth the goale≈øt and free≈øt, the barke being ≈ømooth and apte≈øt to be rai≈øed, that they may be grafted vpon; yet diuers other Plummes may be taken, if they be not at hand, or to be had, as the blacke and red Peare Plumme, the <pb n="539" facs="tcp:15790:276"/> white and red Wheate Plumme, becau≈øe they are neare≈øt in goodne≈ø≈øe vnto it. Peach ≈øtones will be ≈øoone rai≈øed vp to graft other ≈øorts of Peaches or Nectorins vpon, but the nature of the Peach roote being ≈øpongie, is not to abide long. As for Almonds, they will be rai≈øed from their ≈øtones to be trees of them≈øelues; but they will hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the remouing, and le≈ø≈øe to bee grafted vpon. Apricocke ≈øtones are the wor≈øt to deale withall of any ≈øort of ≈øtone fruit; for although the Apricocke branches are the fitte≈øt ≈øtockes to graft Nectorins of the be≈øt ≈øorts vpon, yet tho≈øe that are rai≈øed from the kernels or ≈øtones will neuer thriue to be brought on for this purpo≈øe; but will ≈øtarue and dye, or hardly grow in a long time to be a ≈øtraight and fit ≈øtocke to be grafted, if it be once remoued. Your Cornellian Cherrie trees are wholly, or for the mo≈øt part rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed from the ≈øtones or kernels; yet I know diuers doe increa≈øe them, by laying in their lowe≈øt branches to take roote: and thus much for ≈øtone fruits. Now for Apples and Peares, to be dealt withall in the ≈øame manner as afore≈øaid. They v≈øe to take the pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of Crabs whereas Veriuyce is made, as al≈øo of Cidar and Perry where they are made, and ≈øowing them, doe rai≈øe vp great ≈øtore of ≈øtockes; for although the beating of the fruit doth ≈øpoile many kernels, yet there will bee enough left that were neuer toucht, and that will ≈øpring: the Crabbe ≈øtockes ≈øome preferre for the fitte≈øt, but I am ≈øure, that the better Apple and Peare kernels will growe fairer, ≈øtraighter, quicklier, and better to be grafted on. You mu≈øt remember, that after two or three yeares you take vp the≈øe ≈øtockes, and when you haue pruned both toppe and roote, to ≈øet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in a thinner and fitter order, to be afterwards grafted in the bud while they are young, as I ≈øhall ≈øhew you by and by, or in the ≈øtocke if you will ≈øuffer them to growe greater. Now likewi≈øe to know which are the fitte≈øt ≈øtockes of all ≈øorts to choo≈øe, thereon to graft euery of the≈øe ≈øorts of fruits, is a point of ≈øome skill indeede; and therefore ob≈øerue them as I doe here ≈øet them downe: for bee you a≈ø≈øured, that they are certaine rules, and knowne experiences, whereunto you may tru≈øt without being deceiued. Your blacke Cherrie ≈øtockes (as I ≈øaid before) are the fitte≈øt and be≈øt for all ≈øorts of Cherries long to abide and pro≈øper, and euen May or early Cherry will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide or liue longer, being grafted thereon, either in the budde or in the ≈øtocke, then on the ordinary red Cherry ≈øtocke; but the red Cherry ≈øtocke is in a manner the onely tree that mo≈øt Nur≈øery men doe take to graft May Cherries on in the ≈øtocke (for it is but a late experience of many, to graft May Cherries in the bud) many al≈øo doe graft May Cherries on Ga≈øcoigne Cherry ≈øtockes, which doe not onely thrine well, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure longer then vpon any ordinay Cherry ≈øtocke: For indeede the May Cherries that are grafted vpon ordinary red Cherrie ≈øtockes, will hardly hold aboue a dozen yeares bearing well, although they come forwarder at the fir≈øt, that is, doe beare ≈øoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then tho≈øe that are grafted on Ga≈øcoigne or blacke Cherry ≈øtockes; but as they are earlier in bearing, ≈øo they are ≈øooner ≈øpent, and the Ga≈øcoigne and blacke Cherry ≈øtockes that are longer in comming forward, will la≈øt twice or thrice their time; but many more grafts will mi≈ø≈øe in grafting of the≈øe, then of tho≈øe red Cherry ≈øtockes, and be≈øides, the natures of the Ga≈øcoigne and blacke Cherry ≈øtockes are to ri≈øe higher, and make a goodlier tree then the ordinary red ≈øtocke will, which for the mo≈øt part ≈øprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth wide, but ri≈øeth not very high. The Engli≈øh red Cherry ≈øtocke will ≈øerue very well to graft any other ≈øort of Cherry vpon, and is v≈øed in mo≈øt places of this Land, and I know no other greater inconuenience in it, then that it ≈øhooteth out many ≈øuckers from the roote, which yet by looking vnto may ≈øoone bee remoued from doing any harme, and that it will not la≈øt ≈øo long as the Ga≈øcoigne or blacke Cherry ≈øtocke will. May Cherries thus grafted lowe, doe mo≈øt v≈øually ≈øerue to be planted again≈øt a wall, to bring on the fruit the earlier; yet ≈øome graft them high vpon ≈øtandards, although not many, and it is, I thinke, rather curio≈øity (if they that doe it haue any wals) then anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter that cau≈øeth them thus to doe: for the fruit is naturally ≈ømall, though early, and the ≈øtandard Cherries are alwaies later then the wall Cherries, ≈øo that if they can ≈øpare any roome for them at their wals, they will not plant many in ≈øtandards. Now concerning Plummes (as I ≈øaid before) for the ≈øowing or ≈øetting of the ≈øtones, ≈øo I ≈øay here for their choi≈øe in grafting of them, either in the budde or ≈øtocke. The white Peare Plumme ≈øtocke, and the other there mentioned, but e≈øpecially the white Peare Plumme is the goodlie≈øt, free≈øt, and fitte≈øt of all the re≈øt, as well to graft all ≈øort of Plummes vpon, as al≈øo to graft Apricockes, which can be hand≈øomely, and to any <pb n="540" facs="tcp:15790:277"/> good purpo≈øe grafted vpon no other Plum ≈øtocke, to ri≈øe to bee worth the labour and paine. All ≈øorts of Plums may be grafted in the ≈øtocke, and ≈øo may they al≈øo in the bud; for I know none of them that will refu≈øe to be grafted in the bud, if a cunning hand performe it well; that is, to take off your bud cleanely and well, when you haue made choice of a fit cyon: for, as I ≈øhal ≈øhew you anon, it is no ≈ømall peece of cunning to chu≈øe your cyon that it may yeeld fit buds to graft withall, for euery plum is not of a like apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to yeeld them: But Apricocks cannot be grafted in the ≈øtock for any thing that euer I could heare or learne, but only in the bud, and therefore let your Plum ≈øtocke bee of a rea≈øonable ≈øize for Apricockes e≈øpecially, and not too ≈ømall, that the graft ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow not the ≈øtocke, and that the ≈øtocke bee large enough to nouri≈øh the graft. As your Plum ≈øtockes ≈øerue to graft both Apricockes and Plummes, ≈øo doe they ≈øerue al≈øo very well to graft Peaches of all ≈øorts; and although Peach ≈øtockes will ≈øerue to be grafted with Peaches againe, yet the Peach ≈øtocke (as I ≈øaid before) will not endure ≈øo long as the Plumme ≈øtocke, and therefore ≈øerueth but for nece≈ø≈øity if Plum ≈øtocks be not ready, or at hand, or for the pre≈øent time, or that they afterwards may graft that ≈øort of Peach on a Plumme ≈øtocke: for many might lo≈øe a good fruit, if when they meete with it, and haue not Plumme ≈øtockes ready to graft it on, they could not be a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured that it would take vpon another Peach ≈øtocke or branch, or on the branch of an Apricocke eyther. Plumme ≈øtockes will ≈øerue likewi≈øe very well for ≈øome ≈øorts of Nectorins; I ≈øay, for ≈øome ≈øorts, and not for all: the greene and the yellow Necto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin will be≈øt thriue to be grafted immediately on a Plumme ≈øtocke; but the other two ≈øorts of red Nectorins mu≈øt not be immediately grafted on the Plumme ≈øtocke, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a branch of an Apricocke that hath beene formerly grafted on a Plumme ≈øtocke, the nature of the≈øe Nectorins being found by experience to be ≈øo contrary to the Plum ≈øtocke, that it will ≈øterue it, and both dye within a yeare, two or three at the mo≈øt: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue tryed to graft the≈øe red Nectorins vpon Peach ≈øtockes, and they haue endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red well a while; but ≈øeeing the Peach ≈øtocke will not la≈øt long it ≈øelfe, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weake, how can it hold ≈øo ≈øtrong a nature as the≈øe red Nectorins, which will (as I ≈øaid before) ≈øterue a Plum ≈øtocke that is ≈øufficient durable for any other Plumme?</p>
                  <p>Apricocke ≈øtockes from the ≈øtones are hardly nur≈øed vp, and wor≈øe to be remoued, and if a red Nectorin ≈øhould be grafted on an Apricock ray≈øed from the ≈øtone, and not remoued, I doubt it might happen with it as it doth with many other trees rai≈øed from ≈øtones or kernels, and not remoued, that they would hardly beare fruit: for the nature of mo≈øt trees rai≈øed from ≈øtones or kernels, and not remoued, is to ≈øend great downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right rootes, and not to ≈øpread many forwards; ≈øo that if they be not cut away that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may ≈øpreade abroad, I haue ≈øeldome ≈øeene or known any of them to beare in any rea≈øonable time; and therefore in remouing, the≈øe great downe-right rootes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ≈øhred away, and thereby made fit to ≈øhoote others forwards. Hereby you may perceiue, that the≈øe red Nectorins will not abide to bee grafted vpon any other ≈øtocke well, then vpon an Apricocke branch, although the green and the yellow (as I ≈øaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) will well endure and thriue vpon Plums. The ≈øuckers or ≈øhootes both of Plums and Cherries that ri≈øe from their rootes, eyther neare their ≈øtockes, or farther off, ≈øo that they bee taken with ≈øome ≈ømall rootes to them, will ≈øerue to bee ≈øtockes, and will come forward quickly; but if the ≈øuckers haue no ≈ømall roots whereby they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in the ground, it is almo≈øt impo≈ø≈øible it ≈øhould hold or abide. There is another way to ray≈øe vp eyther ≈øtockes to graft on, or trees without grafting, which is, by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumci≈øing a faire and fit branch in this manner: About Mid≈øomer, when the ≈øappe is thoroughly ri≈øen (or before if the yeare be forward) they v≈øe to binde a good quantity of clay round about a faire and ≈øtraight branch, of a rea≈øonable good ≈øize or bigne≈ø≈øe, with ≈øome conuenient bands, whether it be ropes of hey, or of any other thing, about an handfull aboue the ioynt, where the branch ≈øpreadeth from the tree, and cutting the barke thereof round about vnder the place where the clay is bound, the ≈øap is hereby hindered from ri≈øing, or de≈øcending further then that place ≈øo circumci≈øed, whereby it will ≈øhoote out ≈ømall knubs and rootes into the clay, which they ≈øuffer ≈øo to abide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the beginning of winter, whenas with a fine Sawe they cut off that branch where it was circumci≈øed, and afterwardes place it in the ground where they would haue it to grow, and ≈øtake it, and binde it fa≈øt, which will ≈øhoote forth rootes, and will become eyther a faire tree to beare fruite without grafting, or el≈øe a fit ≈øtocke to graft on accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <pb n="541" facs="tcp:15790:277"/> to the kinde: but oftentimes this kinde of propagation mi≈ø≈øeth, in that it ≈øendeth not forth rootes ≈øufficient to cau≈øe it to abide any long time. Let me yet before I leaue this narration of Plummes, giue you one admonition more, that vpon what≈øoeuer Plumme ≈øtocke you doe graft, yet vpon a Dam≈øon ≈øtocke that you neuer ≈øtriue to graft, for it (aboue all other ≈øorts of Plumme ≈øtockes) will neuer giue you a tree worth your labour. It remaineth only of ≈øtone fruit, that I ≈øpeake of Cornelles, which as yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ≈øaw grafted vpon any ≈øtocke, being as it ≈øhould ≈øeeme vtterly repugnant to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, to abide grafting, but is wholly ray≈øed vp (as I ≈øaid before) eyther from the ≈øtones, or from the ≈øuckers or layers. For Peares and Apples your v≈øuall ≈øtockes to graft on are (as I ≈øaid before, ≈øpeaking of the nur≈øing vp of trees from the kernels) your Crabbe ≈øtockes, and they bee accepted in euery Countrey of this Land as they may conueniently be had, yet many doe take the ≈øtockes of better fruit, whether they bee ≈øuckers, or ≈øtockes ray≈øed from the kernels (and the mo≈øt common and knowne way of grafting, is in the ≈øtocke for all ≈øorts of them, although ≈øome doe v≈øe whipping, packing on, or inci≈øing, as euery one li≈øt to call it: but now we doe in many places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to deale with Peares and Apples as with other ≈øtone fruit, that is, graft them all in the bud, which is found the mo≈øt compendious and ≈øafe≈øt way both to pre≈øerue your ≈øtocke from peri≈øhing, and to bring them the ≈øooner to couer the ≈øtock, as al≈øo to make the goodlier and ≈øtraighter tree, being grafted at what height you plea≈øe:) for tho≈øe ≈øtockes that are ray≈øed from the kernels of good fruit (which are for the mo≈øt part ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily knowne from others, in that they want tho≈øe thornes or prickles the wilde kindes are armed withall:) I ≈øay for the mo≈øt part; for I know that the kernels of ≈øome good fruite hath giuen ≈øtockes with prickles on them (which, as I thinke, was becau≈øe that good fruite was taken from a wilde ≈øtocke that had not beene long enough grafted to alter his wilde nature; for the longer a tree is grafted, the more ≈øtrength the fruite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from the graft, and the le≈ø≈øe ≈øtill from the ≈øtocke) being ≈ømoother and fairer then the wilde kinds, mu≈øt needes make a goodlier tree, and will not alter any whit the ta≈øte of your fruit that is grafted thereon, but rather adde ≈øome better relli≈øh thereunto; for the Crabbe ≈øtockes yeelding har≈øh fruite, mu≈øt giue part of their nature to the grafts are ≈øet thereon, and therefore the ta≈øte or relli≈øh, as well as ≈øome other naturall properties of mo≈øt fruits, are ≈øomewhat altered by the ≈øtocke. Another thing I would willingly giue you to vnder≈øtand concerning your fruits and ≈øtockes, that whereas diuers for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio≈øity and to try experiments haue grafted Cherries vpon Plumme ≈øtockes, or Plums on Cherry ≈øtockes, Apples vpon Peare ≈øtockes, and Peares vpon Apple ≈øtockes, ≈øome of the≈øe haue held the graft a yeare, two or three peraduenture, but I neuer knew that euer they held long, or to beare fruite, much le≈ø≈øe to abide or doe well: be≈øtow not therefore your paines and time on ≈øuch contrary natures, vnle≈ø≈øe it be for curio≈øitie, as others haue done: Yet I know that they that graft peares on a white thorne ≈øtocke haue had their grafts ≈øeeme to thriue well, and continue long, but I haue ≈øeldome ≈øeene the fruite thereof an≈øwerable to the naturall wilde Peare ≈øtocke; yet the Medlar is knowne to thriue be≈øt on a white thorne. And la≈øtly, whereas diuers doe affirme that they may haue not only good ≈øtockes to graft vpon, but al≈øo faire trees to bear ≈øtore of fruit from the kernels of Peares or Apples being prickt into the ground, and ≈øuffered to grow without remouing, and then eyther grafted or ≈øuffered to grow into great trees vngrafted; and for their bearing of fruite, a≈ø≈øigne a dozen or twenty yeares from the fir≈øt ≈øetting of the kernels, and abiding vngrafted, I haue not ≈øeene or heard that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to hold certaine, or if it ≈øhould be ≈øo, yet it is too long time lo≈øt, and too much fruit al≈øo, to waite twenty yeares for that profit may be gained in a great deale of le≈ø≈øe time, and with more certainty. Vnto the≈øe in≈øtructions let mee adde al≈øo one more, which is not much known and v≈øed, and that is, to haue fruit within foure or fiue years from the fir≈øt ≈øowing of your ≈øtones or kernels in this manner: After your ≈øtones or kernels are two or three yeares old, take the faire≈øt toppe or branch, and graft it as you would doe any other cyon taken from a bearing tree, and looke what rare fruite, eyther Peare or Apple, the kernell was of that you ≈øowed, or Peach or Plum &amp;c. the ≈øtone was ≈øet, ≈øuch fruite ≈øhall you haue within two or three yeares at the mo≈øt after the grafting, if it take, and the ≈øtocke be good. And thus may you ≈øee fruit in farre le≈ø≈øe time then to ≈øtay vntill the tree from a kernell or ≈øtone beareth fruit of it ≈øelfe.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Inarching is another manner of grafting in the ≈øtocke, and is more trouble≈øome, and more ca≈øuall al≈øo then the former, and is rather a curio≈øity then any way of good ≈øpeede, certainety or profit, and therefore v≈øed but of a few. Yet to ≈øhew you, the
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:15790:279"/> manner thereof, it is thus: Hauing a tree well growne, bee it high or low, yet the lower the better, with young branches well ≈øpread, they v≈øe to ≈øet ≈øtockes round about it, or on the one ≈øide as you plea≈øe; into which ≈øtockes they ingraft the young branches of the well growne tree as they are growing (before they cut them from the tree) by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe the branch they intend to graft, and putting it into the ≈øtocke, hauing fir≈øt cut off the head thereof, and cut a notch in the middle of the head a little ≈ølope on both ≈øides, wherein the branch mu≈øt be fitted: let the branch be cut thinne on the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øide, only of that length as may ≈øuffice to fit the notch in the ≈øtocke, leauing about halfe a yarde length of the branch, to ri≈øe aboue or beyond the ≈øtocke, which beeing bound on, and clayed ouer or couered with red or greene ≈øoft waxe, they let ≈øo abide, that if it take in the ≈øtocke they cut off the branch a little below the grafting place in Nouember following, and remouing the ≈øtocke, they haue thus gained a grafted and growne tree the fir≈øt yeare: but it is v≈øually ≈øeene, that where one branch taketh, three doe mi≈ø≈øe: yet this manner of grafting was much in v≈øe for May Cherries, when they were fir≈øt known to vs, and the way thought to be a rare manner of grafting to encrea≈øe them, vntill a better way was found out, which now is ≈øo common and good al≈øo, that this is not now ≈øcarce thought vpon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another kinde of grafting in the ≈øtocke is called of ≈øome whipping, of ≈øome ≈øplicing, of others inci≈øing, and of others packing on (and as I heare, is much v≈øed in the We≈øt parts e≈øpecially, and al≈øo in the North parts of this Land) and is performed in this manner: Take and ≈ølice the branch of a tree (≈øo as the branch be not too bigge) or el≈øe a young tree of two, or three, or foure yeares growth at the mo≈øt, quite off ≈ølope wi≈øe, about an inch and a halfe long or more, and cut a deep notch in the middle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then fit into it a graft iu≈øt of that ≈øize or bigne≈ø≈øe, cut on both ≈øides with ≈øhoulders, and thin at the end, that it may ioyne clo≈øe in the notch, and neyther bigger or le≈ø≈øer, but that the barke of the one may bee fitted iu≈øt to the barke of the other, the figure wherof is expre≈ø≈øed at the letters E.F. which ≈øhew the one to be with a ≈øhoulder &amp; the other without; binde them gently together with ba≈øt, and put clay or waxe ouer the place, vntill it be taken: this is much v≈øed of late dayes for ≈øuch young trees as are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen of ≈øtones or kernels after the ≈øecond or third yeares growth, and thriue very well in that it not only ≈øaueth much time, but diuers checks by remouing and grafting.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Inoculating or grafting in the budde is another manner of grafting, which is the taking of a budde from one tree, and putting it into the barke of another tree, to the end, that thereby you may haue of the ≈øame kinde of fruit the tree bare from whence the budde was taken; and although it bee ≈øufficiently knowne in many places of this Land, yet as I vnder≈øtand, good Gardiners in the North parts, and likewi≈øe in ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, can ≈øcarce tell what it meaneth, or at the lea≈øt how to doe it well. It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed after a different fa≈øhion from the former, although they all tend vnto one end, which is the propagating of trees. You mu≈øt for this purpo≈øe ob≈øerue, that for tho≈øe trees you would graft, either with, or vpon, you choo≈øe a fit time in Summer, when the ≈øappe is well ri≈øen, and your graft well ≈øhot, that the barke will ri≈øe ea≈øily and cleanly, both of ≈øtocke and graft, which time I cannot appoint, becau≈øe both the years doe differ in earline≈ø≈øe, and the ≈øeuerall parts or countries of this Land likewi≈øe one from another, but mo≈øt v≈øually in the≈øe Southerne parts, from the beginning of Iune vnto the end of it, or to the middle of Iuly, or either ≈øomewhat before or after. Fir≈øt (as I ≈øaid) hauing taken the fitte≈øt time of the yeare, you mu≈øt take e≈øpeciall care, that your grafts be well growne, and of the ≈øame yeares ≈øhoote, and al≈øo that the buds or eyes haue but ≈øingle leaues at them, as neare as you can: for I would vtterly refu≈øe tho≈øe buds that haue aboue two leaues as vnprofitable, either in Peaches or any other fruit; and therefore ≈øee that your grafts or cyons bee taken from the chiefe≈øt place of the tree, that is, either from the toppe, or from a ≈øunnie ≈øide thereof, and not from the contrarie ≈øide if you may otherwi≈øe, nor from any vnder-boughes; for ≈øeeing your graft is ≈øo ≈ømall a thing, you had neede take the more care that it be the be≈øt and faire≈øt. You mu≈øt to take off this eye or budde from the ≈øprigge, haue a ≈ømall ≈øharpe pen-knife, the end of the haft being made flat and thinne, like a che≈ø≈øell or wedge, the figure whereof is ≈øet forth at the letter B, and a pen or goo≈øe quill cut, to be le≈ø≈øe then halfe round, and to be broad at the end, but not ≈øharpe pointed like a penne, or el≈øe ≈øuch a peece of bone or Iuorie made in that fa≈øhion as the quill is, to bee thinne, hollow, or <pb n="545" facs="tcp:15790:279"/> halfe round, the figures of both which are marked with the letters C, D. with your knife cut the barke of the bud (hauing fir≈øt cut off the leafe, leauing onely the ≈øhort foote-≈øtalke thereof at the bud) about a ≈øtrawes breadth aboue the eye thereof halfe round, and then from that round or ouerthwart cut, with your knife cut it downe on both ≈øides of the eye, clo≈øe to the bud ≈ølopewi≈øe about an inch long or thereabouts, that it bee broad at the head aboue the eye, and pointing at the end like a ≈øheild or ≈øcutcheon; and then cutting away the re≈øt of the barke from about it, with the thinne flat end of the haft of your knife rai≈øe vp both ≈øides of your bud a little, and with your quill or bone put vnder the barke, rai≈øe your budde, and thru≈øt it quite off, beginning at the toppe or head of your eye; but ≈øee that you thru≈øt it off clo≈øe to the wood of the branch or ≈øprigge, and that you doe not leaue the eye of the budde behinde ≈øticking vpon the branch; for if that eye be left or lo≈øt, your bud is worth nothing; you mu≈øt ca≈øt it away, and cut another that may haue that eye abiding within the budde on the in≈øide: you may perceiue if that eye be wanting, if you ≈øee an emptie hole in the place where the eye ≈øhould be, to fill it vp on the in≈øide thereof; thus hauing taken off your bud well and cleanly, which is ≈øet forth vnto you at the figures 3 and 4. pre≈øently ≈øet it on the tree you would graft (for your ≈ømall bud can abide no delay, le≈øt by taking the ayre too long it become dry, and nothing worth) in this manner: Cut the barke of your tree you would graft in a ≈ømooth place, at what height you plea≈øe, fir≈øt aboue or ouerthwart, and then downe right in the middle thereof, more then an inch long, the figure whereof you ≈øhall haue at the figure 1. and then rai≈øe vp both ≈øides of the barke, fir≈øt one, and then another, with the flat and thinne haft end of your knife, a prettie way inwards (for if the barke will not ri≈øe ea≈øily, the ≈øtocke is not then fit to graft vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) put in your budde into the cleft with the point downewards, holding the ≈øtalke of the leafe that is with the budde betweene your fingers of the one hand, and opening the cleft with the flat end of your knife with the other hand, that the head of your bud may be put clo≈øe vnder the ouerthwart cut in the ≈øtocke or tree (which mu≈øt not be rai≈øed or ≈øtirred as the ≈øides are) &amp; the eye of the bud ≈øtand iu≈øt in the middle of the ≈ølit that is downeright, and then clo≈øing the barke of the ≈øtocke or tree ≈øoftly vnto the bud thus put in with your fingers, let it be bound gently with a ≈ømall long peece of ba≈øte, or other ≈øuch like ≈øoft thing, fir≈øt aboue the eye, &amp; then compa≈ø≈øing it belowe as clo≈øe as you can, but not too hard in any ca≈øe, vntil you haue bound it all ouer the ≈ølit you made, e≈øpecially the lower end, le≈øt any winde get in to dry and ≈øpoile it; and hauing tyed both ends thereof fa≈øt, leaue it ≈øo for a fornight or ≈øomewhat more, in which ≈øpace it will take and hold, if it be well done, which you ≈øhall perceiue, if the bud abide green, and turne not blacke, when you haue vnloo≈øed the tying; for if it hold fa≈øt to the tree, and be fre≈øh and good, tye it vp gently againe, and ≈øo leaue it for a fortnight longer, or a moneth if you will, and then you may take away your binding cleane: this budde will (if no other mi≈øchance happen vnto it) ≈øpring and ≈øhoote forth the next yeare, (and ≈øometimes the ≈øame yeare, but that is ≈øeldome) and therefore in the beginning of the yeare, cut off the head of the grafted tree about an handfull aboue the grafted place, vntill the graft be growne ≈øtrong, and then cut it off clo≈øe, that the head may be couered with the graft, and doe not ≈øuffer any buds to ≈øprout be≈øides the graft, either aboue or belowe it. If you graft diuers buds vpon one ≈øtocke (which is the be≈øt way) let that onely remaine and abide that ≈øhooteth be≈øt forth, and rubbe off, or take away the other: the ≈øeuerall parts of this grafting I haue cau≈øed to be expre≈ø≈øed for your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther information.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Grafting in the ≈øcutcheon is accounted another kinde of grafting, and differeth verie little from grafting in the budde: the difference chiefly con≈øi≈øteth in this, that in ≈øtead of the downe right ≈ølit, and that aboue ouerthwart, they take away iu≈øt ≈øo much barke of the great tree, as your bud is in bigne≈ø≈øe, which v≈øually is a little larger then the former, and placing it therein, they binde it as formerly is ≈øaid: ≈øome v≈øe for this purpo≈øe a paire of compa≈ø≈øes, to giue the true mea≈øure both of bud and ≈øtocke; this manner of grafting is mo≈øt v≈øed vpon greater trees, who≈øe young branches are too high to graft vpon in the former maner, and who≈øe tops they cut off (for the mo≈øt part) at the latter end of the next yeare after the bud is taken: both the≈øe waies were inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ≈øaue the lo≈ø≈øe of trees, which are more endangered by grafting in the ≈øtocke, <pb n="546" facs="tcp:15790:280"/> then any of the≈øe waies; and be≈øides, by the≈øe waies you may graft at a farre grea height without lo≈ø≈øe.</p>

                  <p>HAuing now ≈øpoken of the grafting of trees, let mee adioyne the properties of Ro≈øes, which although they better fit a Garden then an Orchard, yet I could not in a fitter place expre≈ø≈øe them then here, both for the name and affinity of grafting, &amp; becau≈øe I do not expre≈ø≈øe it in the fir≈øt part. All ≈øorts of Ro≈øes may be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (although all ≈øorts are not, ≈øome ≈øeruing rather for ≈øtockes for others to be grafted on) as ea≈øily as any other tree, &amp; is only performed, by inoculating in the ≈øame maner I haue ≈øet downe in the former Chapter of grafting trees in the bud; for both ≈øtocke and budde mu≈øt bee dealt with after the ≈øame fa≈øhion. And although ≈øome haue boa≈øted of grafting Ro≈øes by ≈ølicing or whipping, as they call it, or in the ≈øtocke, after the fir≈øt manner, ≈øet downe in the former Chapter, yet I thinke it rather a bragge, not hauing ≈øeene or heard any true effect proceede from that relation. The ≈øweete Briar or Eglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, the white and the Damaske Ro≈øes, are the chiefe≈øt ≈øtockes to graft vpon. And if you graft lowe or neare the ground, you may by laying downe that graft within the ground, after it hath bin ≈øhot out well, and of a years growth, by pinning it fa≈øt downe with ≈øhort ≈øtickes, a thwart or acro≈ø≈øe, cau≈øe that grafted branch, by taking roote, to become a naturall Ro≈øe, ≈øuch as the graft was, which being ≈øeparated and tran≈øplanted after it hath taken root wel, will pro≈øper as well as any naturall ≈øucker. And in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by laying downe branchese at length into the ground, if they be full of ≈øpreading ≈ømall branches, you may increa≈øe all ≈øorts of Ro≈øes quickly and plentifully; for they will ≈øhoote forth rootes at the ioynt of euery branch: But as for the manner of grafting white Ro≈øes or Damaske vpon Broome ≈øtalkes or Barbary bu≈øhes, to cau≈øe them to bring forth double yellow Ro≈øes, or vpon a Willowe, to beare greene Ro≈øes, they are all idle conceits, as impo≈ø≈øible to be effected, as other things, whereof I haue ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ninth Chapter of my fir≈øt part, concerning a Garden of flowers, vnto which I referre you to be ≈øatisfied with the rea≈øons there alledged. And it is the more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe we haue a naturall double yellow Ro≈øe of it owne growing. The ≈øowing of the ≈øeedes of Ro≈øes (which are ≈øometimes found vpon mo≈øt ≈øorts of Ro≈øes, although not euery yeare, and in euerie place) hath bin formerly much v≈øed; but now the laying downe of the young ≈øhootes is a way for increa≈øe ≈øo much v≈øed, being ≈øafe and verie ≈øpeedie to take, e≈øpecially for tho≈øe Ro≈øes that are not ≈øo apt to giue ≈øuckers, that it hath almo≈øt taken quite away the v≈øe of ≈øowing of the ≈øeedes of Ro≈øes, which yet if anie one bee di≈øpo≈øed to make the triall, they mu≈øt gather the ≈øeede out of the round heads, from among≈øt the doune, wherein they lye verie like vnto the berries of the Eglantine or ≈øweete Briar bu≈øh, and e≈øpecially of tho≈øe Ro≈øes that bee of the more ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle kindes, which are more apt to giue berries for ≈øeed then the more double, although ≈øometimes the double Ro≈øes yeeld the like heads or berries. Their time of ≈øowing is in the end of September (yet ≈øome re≈øerue them vntill February) and their manner of nour≈øing is to bee tran≈øplanted, after the fir≈øt or ≈øecond yeares growth, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded carefully, that while they are young they be not lo≈øt for want of moi≈øture in the dry time of Summer.</p>

                  <p>THe time of ≈øome manners of grafting being not mentioned before, mu≈øt here be ≈øpoken of. For the grafting of all ≈øorts of trees in the ≈øtocke, the mo≈øt v≈øuall time is from the middle of February vntill the middle of March, as the yeare and the countrie is more forward or backward, with vs about London wee neuer pa≈ø≈øe midde March: but becau≈øe the May Cherrie is fir≈øt ripe, and therefore of a very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nature, it doth require to be grafted ≈øomewhat ≈øooner then others. The time of gathering likewi≈øe, or cutting your grafts for grafting in the ≈øtocke, is to be ob≈øerued, that they bee not long gathered before they bee grafted, for feare of being too dry, which I commend, how≈øoeuer diuers ≈øay, if they be long kept they are not the wor≈øe; and therefore if you be forced to haue your grafts from farre, or by ≈øome other chance to keepe them long, be carefull to keepe them moi≈øt, by keeping their ends ≈øtucke in moi≈øt clay; but if neare hand, neglect no time I ≈øay after the cutting of them for their grafting, but either the ≈øame, or the next day, or verie ≈øpeedily after, in the meane time being put into the ground to keepe them fre≈øh. The grafts taken from old trees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are ≈øtronger, and ≈øhoote forth ≈øooner, are to bee ≈øooner grafted then tho≈øe that are taken from younger trees: of a good branch may bee made two, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three grafts ≈øufficient for anie rea≈øonable ≈øtocke. For whipping, the time is ≈øomewhat later then grafting in the ≈øtocke, becau≈øe it is performed on younger trees, which (as I ≈øaid before) doe not ≈øo early bud or ≈øhoote forth as the elder. Inarching likewi≈øe is performed much about the later end of the grafting time in the ≈øtocke; for being both kindes thereof they require the ≈øame time of the yeare. The times of the other manners of graftings are before expre≈ø≈øed, to bee when they haue ≈øhot forth young branches, from whence your buds mu≈øt be taken; and therefore need not here againe to be repeated. If a graft in the ≈øtocke doth happen not to ≈øhoote forth when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do (≈øo as it holdeth green) it may perchance ≈øhoot out a moneth or two after, &amp; do well, or el≈øe after Mid≈øummer, when a ≈øecond time of ≈øhooting, or the after Spring ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth: but haue an e≈øpeciall care, that you take not ≈øuch a graft that ≈øhal haue nothing but buds for flowers vpon it, and not an eye or bud for leaues (which you mu≈øt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to di≈øtingui≈øh) for ≈øuch a graft after it hath ≈øhot out the flowers mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øitie dye, not hauing wherewith to maintaine it ≈øelfe. Al≈øo if your good graft doe mi≈ø≈øe, and not take, it doth hazzard your ≈øtocke at the fir≈øt time, yet manie ≈øtockes doe recouer to be grafted the ≈øecond time; but twice to faile is deadly, which is not ≈øo in the inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of buds in the greene tree: for if you faile therein three, or three times three, yet euerie wound being ≈ømall, and the tree ≈øtill growing greene, will quickly recouer it, and not be afterwards ≈øeen. Some v≈øe to graft in the ≈øtocke the ≈øame yeare they remoue the ≈øtocke, to ≈øaue time, &amp; a ≈øecond checke by grafting; but I like better both in grafting in the ≈øtocke, and in the bud al≈øo, that your trees might be planted in the places where you would haue them growe, for a yeare or two at the lea≈øt before you graft them, that after grafting there ≈øhould be no remouall, I neede not be tedious, not yet I hope ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ≈øollicitous to remember many other triuiall, or at the lea≈øt common knowne things in this matter. Fir≈øt, for the time to remoue trees, young or old, grafted or vngrafted, to be from a fortnight after Michaelmas vntill Candlemas, or if neede be, ≈øomewhat after, yet the ≈øooner your remoue is, the better your trees will thriue, except it be in a very moi≈øt ground. For the manner or way to ≈øet them: <hi>viz.</hi> in the high and dry grounds ≈øet them deeper, both to haue the more moi≈øture, and to be the better defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from windes; and in the lower and moi≈øter grounds ≈øhallower, and that the earth be mellow, well turned vp, and that the finer earth bee put among the ≈ømall rootes, wherein they may ≈øpread, and afterwards gently troden downe, that no hollowne≈ø≈øe remaine among the rootes: as al≈øo that after ≈øetting (if the time be not ouermoi≈øt) there may be ≈øome water powred to the rootes, to moi≈øten and fa≈øten them the better; and in the dry time of Summer, after the ≈øetting, let them not want moi≈øture, if you will <pb n="548" facs="tcp:15790:281"/> haue them thriue and pro≈øper; for the want thereof at that time, hath often Killed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a likely tree. To ≈øtake and fence them al≈øo if neede bee after they are new ≈øet, and ≈øo to continue for two or three yeares after, is verie expedient, le≈øt windes or other ca≈øualties ≈øpoile your paines, and ouerthrow your hopes. And likewi≈øe to defend your grafts from birds lighting on them, to breake or di≈øplace them, to ≈øticke ≈øome prickes or ≈øharpe pointed ≈øtickes longer then your graft into your clay, that ≈øo they may be a ≈øure defence of it: As al≈øo to tye ≈øome woollen cloathes about the lower end of your ≈øtockes, or thru≈øt in ≈øome thornes into the ground about the rootes, to defend them from hauing their barkes eaten by

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Ob≈øeruations for the dre≈øsing and well keeping of Trees and an Orchard in good order.</head>
                  <p>THere are two manner of waies to dre≈ø≈øe and keepe trees in good order, that they may bee both gracefull and fruitfull; the one is for wall-trees, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is for ≈øtandards: for as their formes are different, ≈øo is their keeping or ordering. Wall trees, becau≈øe they are grafted lowe, and that their branches mu≈øt be pla≈øht or tackt vnto the wall to fa≈øten them, are to be ≈øo kept, that all their branches may be ≈øuffered to growe, that ≈øhoote forth on eithet ≈øide of the bodie, and led either along the wall, or vpright, and one to lappe ouer or vnder another as is convenient, and ≈øtill with peeces of li≈øts, parings of felt, peeces of ≈øoft leather, or other ≈øuch like ≈øoft thing compa≈ø≈øing the armes or branches, fa≈øtened with ≈ømall or great nailes, as neede requireth, to the wals, onely tho≈øe buds or branches are to be nipped or cut off, that ≈øhoot forward, and will not ≈øo hand≈øomely be brought into conformity, as is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; yet if the branches growe too thicke, to hinder the good of the re≈øt, or too high for the wall, they may, nay they mu≈øt be cut away or lopped off: and if anie dead branches al≈øo happen to be on the trees, they mu≈øt be cut away, that the re≈øt may haue the more libertie to thriue. Diuers al≈øo by carefully nipping away the wa≈øte and ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous buds, doe keepe their trees in conformity, without much cutting. The time to pruine or pla≈øh, or tye vp wall trees, is v≈øually from the fall of the leafe, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the yeare, when they begin to blo≈ø≈øome, and mo≈øt e≈øpecially a little before or after Chri≈øtmas: but in any ca≈øe not too late, for feare of rubbing off their buds. Some I know doe pla≈øh and tye vp their wall trees after bearing time, while the leaues are greene, and their rea≈øon is, the buds are not ≈øo ea≈øie or apt to bee rubbed from the branches at that time, as at Chri≈øtmas, when they are more growne: but the leaues mu≈øt needes be very cumber≈øome, to hinder much both the orderly placing, and clo≈øe fa≈øtening of them to the wall. This labour you mu≈øt performe euery yeare in its due time; for if you ≈øhall neglect and ouer≈ølip it, you ≈øhall haue much more trouble, to bring them into a fit order againe, then at the fir≈øt. The ≈øtandard trees in an Orchard mu≈øt be kept in another order; for whereas the former are ≈øuffered to ≈øpread at large, the≈øe mu≈øt be pruined both from ≈øuperfluous branches that ouerload the trees, &amp; make them le≈ø≈øe fruitfull, as well as le≈ø≈øe ≈øightly, and the vnder or water boughes likewi≈øe, that drawe much nouri≈øhment from the trees, and yet them≈øelues little the better for it, I meane to giue fruit. If therefore your Orchard con≈øi≈øt of young trees, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care and paines it may bee kept in that comely order and proportion it was fir≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtined vnto; but if it con≈øi≈øt of old growne trees, they will not without a great deale of care and paines be brought into ≈øuch conformitie, as is befitting good and comely trees: for the marke of tho≈øe boughes or branches that are cut off from young trees, will quickly be healed againe, the barke growing quickly ouer them, whereby they are not wor≈øe for their cutting; but an old tree if you cut off a bough, you mu≈øt cut it clo≈øe and cleanly, and lay a ≈øearcloth of tallow, waxe, and a little pitch melted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the place, to keepe off both the winde, ≈øunne, and raine, vntill the barke haue couered it ouer againe: and in this manner you mu≈øt deale withall ≈øuch ≈øhort ≈øtumps of branches, as are either broken ≈øhort off with the winde, or by carele≈øne≈ø≈øe of <pb n="549" facs="tcp:15790:281"/> want of skill, or el≈øe ≈øuch armes or branches as are broken off clo≈øe, or ≈øliued from the body of the tree: for the raine beating and falling into ≈øuch a place, will in ≈øhort time rotte your tree, or put it in danger, be≈øides the deformity. Some v≈øe to fill vp ≈øuch an hole with well tempered clay, and tacke a cloth or a peece of leather ouer it vntill it be recouered, and this is al≈øo not ami≈ø≈øe. Your young trees, if they ≈øtand in anie good ground, will bee plentifull enough in ≈øhooting forth branches; bee carefull therefore if they growe too thicke, that you pruine away ≈øuch as growe too clo≈øe (and will, if they be ≈øuffered, ≈øpoile one another) as they may be be≈øt ≈øpared, that ≈øo the ≈øunne, ayre, and raine may haue free acce≈ø≈øe to all your branches, which will make them beare the more plentifully, and ripen them the ≈øooner and the more kindly. If anie boughes growe at the toppe too high, cut them al≈øo away, that your trees may rather ≈øpread then growe too high. And ≈øo likewi≈øe for the vnder boughes, or anie other that by the weight of fruit fall or hang downe, cut them off at the halfe, and they will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ri≈øe and ≈øhoote vpwards. You ≈øhall ob≈øerue, that at all tho≈øe places where anie branches haue been cut away, the ≈øappe will euer bee readie to put forth: if therefore you would haue no more branches ri≈øe from that place, rubbe off or nippe off ≈øuch buddes as are not to your minde, when they are new ≈øhot: and thus you may keep your trees in good order with a little paines, after you haue thus pruined and dre≈ø≈øed them. One other thing I would aduerti≈øe you of, and that is how to pre≈øerue a fainting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying tree which is readie to peri≈øh, if it be not gone too farre or pa≈øt cure, take a good quantitie of oxe or hor≈øe bloud, mixe therewith a rea≈øonable quantitie of ≈øheepe or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons dung, which being laid to the roote, will by the often raines and much watering recouer it ≈øelfe, if there bee anie po≈ø≈øibilitie; but this mu≈øt bee done in Ianuarie or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruarie at the furthe≈øt.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Diuers other ob≈øeruations to be remembred in the well keeping of an Orchard.</head>
                  <p>THere be diuers other things to be mentioned, whereof care mu≈øt be had, either to doe or auoide, which I thinke fit in this Chapter promi≈øcuou≈øly to ≈øet down, that there may be nothing wanting to furni≈øh you with ≈øufficient knowledge of the care, paines, and ca≈øualties that befall an Orchard: for it hath many enemies, and euery one laboureth as much as in them lye, to ≈øpoile you of your plea≈øure, or profit, or both, which mu≈øt bee both ≈øpeedily and carefully preuented and helped; and they are the≈øe: Mo≈ø≈øe, Caterpillars, Ants, Earwigs, Snailes, Moales, and Birds. If Mo≈ø≈øe begin to ouergrowe your trees, looke to it betimes, le≈øt it make your trees barren: Some v≈øe to hacke, and cro≈ø≈øehacke, or cut the barke of the bodies of their trees, to cau≈øe it fall away; but I feare it may endanger your trees. Others do either rubbe it off with a haire cloth, or with a long peece of wood formed like a knife, at the end of a long ≈øticke or pole, which if it bee v≈øed cautelou≈øly without hurting the buds, I like better. Caterpillars, ≈øome ≈ømoake them with burning wet ≈øtrawe or hay, or ≈øuch like ≈øtuffe vnder the trees; but I doe not greatly like of that way: others cut off the boughes whereon they breed, and tread them vnder their feete, but that will ≈øpoile too manie branches; and ≈øome kill them with their hands: but ≈øome doe v≈øe a new deui≈øed way, that is, a pompe made of lattin or tin, ≈øpout-fa≈øhion, which being ≈øet in a tubbe of water vnder or neare your trees, they will cau≈øe the water to ri≈øe through it with ≈øuch a force, and through the branches, that it will wa≈øh them off quickly. To de≈øtroy Ants, that eate your fruit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and when it is ripe, ≈øome v≈øe to annoint the bodies of their trees with tarre, that they may not creepe vp on the branches; but if that doe not helpe, or you will not v≈øe it, you mu≈øt be carefull to finde out their hill, and turne it vp, pouring in ≈øcalding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, either in Summer, but e≈øpecially if you can in Winter, and that will ≈øurely de≈øtroy them. I haue ≈øpoken of Earwigs in the fir≈øt part of this worke, entreating of the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Gilloflowers, and therefore I referre you thereunto: yet one way more I <pb n="550" facs="tcp:15790:282"/> will here relate which ≈øome doe v≈øe, and that is with hollow canes of halfe a yard long or more, open at both ends for them to creepe in, and ≈øtucke or laid among the branches of your trees, will ≈øoone drawe into them many Earwigs, which you may ≈øoone kill, by knocking the cane a little vpon the ground, and treading on them with your foote. Snailes mu≈øt be taken with your hands, and that euerie day, e≈øpecially in the morning when they will be creeping abroad. Moales by running vnder your trees make them le≈ø≈øe fruitfull, and al≈øo put them in danger to be blowne downe, by leauing the ground hollow, that thereby the rootes haue not that ≈øtrength in the ground, both to ≈øhoote and to hold, that otherwi≈øe they might haue. Some haue v≈øed to put Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, and other ≈øuch like things into their holes, thinking thereby to driue them away, but to no purpo≈øe: others haue tryed manie other waies; but no way doth auaile anie thing, but killing them either with a Moale ≈øpade, or a trappe made for the purpo≈øe as manie doe know: and they mu≈øt bee watched at their principall hill, and trenched round, and ≈øo to be caught. Birds are another enemie both to your trees and fruit; for the Bullfinch will de≈øtroy all your ≈øtone fruit in the budde, before they flower, if you ≈øuffer them, and Crowes, &amp;c. when your Cherries are ripe: for the ≈ømaller birds, Lime twigs ≈øet either neare your trees, or at the next water where they drinke, will helpe to catch them and de≈øtroy them. And for the greater birds, a ≈øtone bowe, a birding or fowling peece will helpe to le≈ø≈øen their number, and make the re≈øt more quiet: or a mill with a clacke to ≈øcarre them away, vntill your fruit be gathered. Some other annoyances there are, as ≈øuckers that ri≈øe from the rootes of your trees, which mu≈øt be taken away euerie yeare, and not ≈øuffered to growe anie thing great, for feare of robbing your trees of their liuelihood. Barke bound, is when a tree doth not ≈øhoote and encrea≈øe, by rea≈øon the barke is as it were drie, and will not ≈øuffer the ≈øappe to pa≈ø≈øe vnto the branches: take a knife therefore, and ≈ølit the barke downe almo≈øt all the length of the tree in two or three places, and it will remedy that euill, and the tree will thriue and come forward the better after. Barke pilled is another euill that happeneth to ≈øome trees, as well young as old, either by rea≈øon of ca≈øuall hurts, or by the gnawing of bea≈øts, how≈øoeuer it bee, if it bee anie great hurt, lay a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter thereon made of tallow, tarre, and a little pitch, and binde it thereto, letting it ≈øo abide vntill the wound bee healed: yet ≈øome doe only apply a little clay or loame bound on with ropes of hay. The Canker is a ≈øhrewd di≈øea≈øe when it happeneth to a tree; for it will eate the barke round, and ≈øo kill the very heart in a little ≈øpace. It mu≈øt be looked vnto in time before it hath runne too farre; mo≈øt men doe wholly cut away as much as is fretted with the Canker, and then dre≈ø≈øe it, or wet it with vinegar or Cowes pi≈ø≈øe, or Cowes dung and vrine, &amp;c. vntill it be de≈øtroyed, and after healed againe with your ≈øalue before appointed. There are yet ≈øome other enemies to an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard: for if your fence be not of bricke or ≈øtone, but either a mudde wall, or a quicke ≈øet or dead hedge, then looke to it the more carefully, and preuent the comming in of either hor≈øe, or kine, ≈øheepe, goates, or deere, hare, or conie; for ≈øome of them will breake through or ouer to barke your trees, and the lea≈øt hole almo≈øt in the hedge will giue admittance to hares and conies to doe the like. To preuent all which, your care mu≈øt be continuall to watch them or auoide them, and to ≈øtoppe vp their entrance. A dogge is a good ≈øeruant for many ≈øuch purpo≈øes, and ≈øo is a ≈øtone bowe, and a peece to make v≈øe of as occa≈øion ≈øhall ≈øerue. But if you will take that medicine for a Canker ≈øpoken of before, which is Cowes dung and vrine mixed together, and with a bru≈øh wa≈øh your trees often to a rea≈øonable height, will keepe hares and conies from eating or barking your trees. Great and cold windes doe often make a great ≈øpoile in an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, but great trees planted without the compa≈ø≈øe thereof, as Wall-nuts, Oakes, Elmes, A≈øhes, and the like, will ≈øtand it in great ≈øtead, to defend it both early and late. Thus haue I ≈øhewed you mo≈øt of the euils that may happen to an Orchard, and the meanes to helpe them, and becau≈øe the number is great and daily growing, the care and paines mu≈øt be continuall, the more earne≈øt and diligent, le≈øt you lo≈øe that in a moment that hath been growing many yeares, or at the lea≈øt the profit or beauty of ≈øome yeares fruit.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The manner and way how to plant, order, and keepe other trees that beare greene leaues continually.</head>
                  <p>THe way to order tho≈øe trees that beare their leaues greene continually, is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from all others that doe not ≈øo: for neyther are they to bee planted or remoued at the time that all other trees are ≈øet, nor doe they require that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dre≈ø≈øing, pruining and keeping, that others doe. And although many ignorant per≈øons and Gardiners doe remoue Bay trees, and are ≈øo likewi≈øe per≈øwaded that all other trees of that nature, that is, that carry their greene leaues continually, may bee remoued in Autumne or Winter, as well as all other trees may bee; yet it is certaine it is a great chance if they doe thriue and pro≈øper that are ≈øet at that time, or rather it is found by experience, that ≈øcarce one of ten pro≈øpereth well that are ≈øo ordered. Now in regard that there be diuers trees and ≈øhrubs mentioned here in this booke that beare euer greene leaues, wherein there is very great beauty, and many take plea≈øure in them; as the ordinary Bay, the Ro≈øe Bay, and the Cherry Bay trees, the Indian Figge, the Cypre≈ø≈øe, the Pine tree, the Mirtle and dwarfe Boxe, and many others; I will here ≈øhew you how to plant and order them, as is fitte≈øt for them. For in that they doe not ≈øhed their greene leaues in winter as other trees doe, you may in rea≈øon be per≈øwaded that they are of another nature; and ≈øo they are indeede: for ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they all grow naturally in warme Countries, and are from thence brought vnto vs, we mu≈øt both plant them in a warmer place, and tran≈øplant them in a warmer time then other trees be, or el≈øe it is a great hazzard if they doe not peri≈øh and dye, the cold and fro≈øts in the winter being able to pierce them through, if they ≈øhould bee tran≈øplanted in winter, before they haue taken roote. You mu≈øt ob≈øerue and take this therefore for a certaine rule, that you alwaies remoue ≈øuch trees or ≈øhrubbes as are euer greene in the ≈øpring of the yeare, and at no time el≈øe if you will doe well, that is, from the end of March, or beginning of Aprill, vnto the middle or end of May, e≈øpecially your more dainty and tender plants, ≈øhadowing them al≈øo for a while from the heate of the Sun, and giuing them a little water vpon their planting or tran≈øplanting; but ≈øuch water as hath not pre≈øently been drawn from a Well or Pumpe, for that will go neer to kill any plant, but ≈øuch water as hath ≈øtood in the open ayre for a day at the lea≈øt, if not two or three. Yet for dwarfe Boxe I confe≈ø≈øe it may endure one moneth to be earlier planted then the re≈øt, becau≈øe it is both a more hardy and lowe plant, and thereby not ≈øo much ≈øubiect to the extremitie of the colde: but if you ≈øhould plant it before winter, the fro≈øts would rai≈øe it out of the ground, becau≈øe it cannot ≈øo ≈øoone at that time of the yeare take roote, and thereby put it in danger to be lo≈øt. Moreouer all of them will not abide the extremitie of our winter fro≈øts, and therefore you mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity hou≈øe ≈øome of them, as the Ro≈øe Bay, Mirtle, and ≈øome others, but the other ≈øorts being ≈øet where they may bee ≈øomewhat defended from the cold windes, fro≈øtes, and ≈ønow in winter, with ≈øome couering or ≈øhelter for the time, will rea≈øonably well endure and beare their fruit, or the mo≈øt of them. If any be de≈øirous to be furni≈øhed with ≈øtore of the≈øe kinds of trees that will be nour≈øed vp in our Country, he may by ≈øowing the ≈øeed of them in ≈øquare or long woodden boxes or che≈øts made for that purpo≈øe, gaine plenty of them: but hee mu≈øt be carefull to couer them in winter with ≈øome ≈øtraw or fearne, or beane hame, or ≈øuch like thing layd vpon cro≈ø≈øe ≈øticks to beare it vp from the plants, and after two or three yeares that they are growne ≈øomewhat great and ≈øtrong, they may bee tran≈øplanted into ≈øuch places you meane they ≈øhall abide: yet it is not ami≈ø≈øe to defend them the fir≈øt yeare after they are tran≈øplanted, for their more ≈øecuritie: the ≈øeedes that are mo≈øt v≈øually ≈øowen with vs, are, the Cypre≈ø≈øe tree, the Pine tree, the Baye, the Pyracantha or prickly Corall tree, and the Mirtle: the Ro≈øe Bay I haue had al≈øo ri≈øen from the ≈øeede that was fre≈øh, and brought me from Spaine. But as for Orenge trees, becau≈øe they are ≈øo hardly pre≈øerued in this our cold climate (vnle≈ø≈øe it bee with ≈øome that doe be≈øtow the hou≈øing of them, be≈øides a great deale more of care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect vnto them) from the bitterne≈ø≈øe of our cold long winter weather (although their
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:15790:283"/> kernels being put into the ground in the Spring or Summer, and if care bee had of them and conuenient keeping, will abide, and by grafting the good fruite on the crab ≈øtocke they may bee in time nur≈øed vp) I doe not make any other e≈øpeciall account of them, nor giue you any further relation of their ordering. Now for the ordering of the≈øe trees after they are eyther planted of young ≈øets, or tran≈øplanted from the ≈øeede, it is thus: Fir≈øt for Bay trees, the mo≈øt v≈øuall way is to let them grow vp high to bee trees, and many plant them on the North or Ea≈øt ≈øide of their hou≈øes that they may not bee ≈øcorched with the Sunne; but the bitter winters which we often haue, doe pinch them ≈øhrewdly, in≈øomuch that it killeth euen well growne trees ≈øometimes downe to the roote: but ≈øome doe make a hedge of them being planted in order, and keep them low by lopping of them continually, which will make them bu≈øh and ≈øpread. The Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe tree is neuer lopped, but ≈øuffered to grow with all the branches from a foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ground, if it may be, ≈øtraight vpright; for that is his natiue grace and greate≈øt beautie, and therefore the more branches doe dye that they mu≈øt bee cut away, the more you deforme his propertie. The Pine tree may be v≈øed in the ≈øame manner, but yet it wil better endure to ≈øu≈øtaine pruining then the Cypre≈ø≈øe, without any ≈øuch defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. The Laurocera≈øus or Cherry Bay may be diuer≈øly formed, that is, it may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made to grow into a tall tree by ≈øhredding ≈øtill away the vnder branches, or el≈øe by ≈øuffering all the branches to grow to be a low or hedge bu≈øh, &amp; both by the ≈øuckers and by laying downe the lower branches into the earth, you may ≈øoone haue much increa≈øe; but this way will cau≈øe it to bee the longer before it beare anie fruit. The Ro≈øe Baye will verie hardlie bee encrea≈øed either by ≈øuckers or by layers, but mu≈øt bee ≈øuffered to grow without lopping, topping or cutting. The Pyracantha or Prickly Corall tree may bee made to grow into a rea≈øonable tall tree by ≈øhredding away the lower branches, or it may be ≈øuffered to grow lowe into an hedge bu≈øh, by ≈øuffering all the branches to grow continually, you may al≈øo propagate it by the ≈øuckers, or by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe the lower branches. The Myrtle of all ≈øorts abideth a low bu≈øh ≈øpreading his branches full of ≈øweete leaues and flowers, without anie great encrea≈øe of it ≈øelfe, yet ≈øometimes it giueth ≈øuckers or ≈øhootes from the rootes: but for the more ≈øpeedie propagating of them, ≈øome doe put the cuttings of them into the earth, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe them. There are ≈øome other trees that are not of any great re≈øpect, as the Yew tree, and the Savine bu≈øh, both which may be encrea≈øed by the cuttings, and therefore I need not make any further relation or amplification of them, and to ≈øay thus much of them all, is (I thinke) ≈øufficient for this Worke.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The ordering, curing, and propagating Vines of all ≈øorts.</head>
                  <p>IN mo≈øt places of this countrie there is ≈ømall care or paines taken about the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Vines: it ≈øufficeth for the mo≈øt part with them that haue anie, to make a frame for it to ≈øpread vpon aboue a mans height, or to tacke it to a wall or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, &amp;c. and ≈øo to let it hang downe with the branches and fruit, vntill the weight thereof, and the force of windes doe teare it downe oftentimes, and ≈øpoile the grapes: and this way doth ≈øomewhat re≈øemble that cour≈øe that the Vineyard keepers ob≈øerue in the hot countries of Syria, Spaine, and Italy, and in the furthe≈øt parts of France as I hear likewi≈øe: for in mo≈øt of the≈øe hot countries they v≈øe to plant an Oliue betweene two Vines, and let them runne thereupon. But manie of the other parts of France, &amp;c. doe not ≈øuffer anie trees to growe among their Vines; and therefore they plant them thicke, and pruine them much and often, and keepe them lowe in compari≈øon of the other way, fa≈øtening them to pearches or poles to hold them vp. And according to that fa≈øhion many haue aduentured to make Vineyards in England, not onely in the≈øe later daies, but in ancient times, as may wel witne≈ø≈øe the ≈øundrie places in this Land, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled by the name of Vineyards; and I haue read, that manie Mona≈øteries in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hauing Vineyards, had as much wine made therefrom, as ≈øufficed their couents yeare by yeare: but long ≈øince they haue been de≈øtroyed, and the knowledge how to order a Vineyard is al≈øo vtterly peri≈øhed with them. For although diuers, both No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:15790:283"/> and Gentlemen, haue in the≈øe later times endeauoured to plant and make Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and to that purpo≈øe haue cau≈øed French men, being skilfull in keeping and dre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of Vines, to be brought ouer to performe it, yet either their skill failed them, or their Vines were not good, or (the mo≈øt likely) the ≈øoile was not fitting; for they could neuer make anie wine that was worth the drinking, being ≈øo ≈ømall and heartle≈ø≈øe, that they ≈øoone gaue ouer their practice. And indeede the ≈øoile is a maine matter to bee chiefly con≈øidered to ≈øeate a Vineyard vpon: for euen in France and other hot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, according to the nature of the ≈øoile, ≈øo is the relli≈øh, ≈øtrength, and durabilitie of the wine. Now although I think it a fruitle≈ø≈øe labour for any man to ≈øtriue in the≈øe daies to make a good Vineyard in England, in regard not only of the want of knowledge, to make choi≈øe of the fitte≈øt ground for ≈øuch Vines as you would plant therupon, but al≈øo of the true maner of ordering them in our country; but mo≈øt chiefly &amp; aboue all others, that our years in the≈øe times do not fal out to be ≈øo kindly and hot, to ripen the grapes, to make anie good wine as formerly they haue done; yet I thinke it not ami≈ø≈øe, to giue you in≈øtructions how to order ≈øuch Vines as you may nour≈øe vp for the plea≈øure of the fruit, to eate the grapes being ripe, or to pre≈øerue and keepe them to bee eaten almo≈øt all the winter following: And this may be done without any great or extraordinarie paines. Some doe make a lowe wall, and plant their Vines again≈øt it, and keepe them much about the height thereof, not ≈øuffering them to ri≈øe much higher: but if the high bricke or ≈øtone wals of your Garden or Orchard haue buttre≈ø≈øes thereat, or if you cau≈øe ≈øuch to bee made, that they bee ≈øomewhat broade forwards, you may the more conueniently plant Vines of diuers ≈øorts at them, and by ≈øticking down a couple of good ≈øtakes at euery buttre≈ø≈øe, of eight or ten foot high aboue ground, tacking a few lathes acro≈ø≈øe vpon tho≈øe ≈øtakes, you may therunto tye your Vines, &amp; carry them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at your plea≈øure: but you mu≈øt be carefull to cut them euery year, but not too late, and ≈øo keepe them downe, and from farre ≈øpreading, that they neuer runne much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the frame which you ≈øet at the buttre≈ø≈øes: as al≈øo in your cutting you neuer leaue too many ioynts, nor yet too few, but at the third or fourth ioint at the mo≈øt cut them off. I doe adui≈øe you to the≈øe frames made with ≈øtakes and lathes, for the better ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your grapes: for in the blooming time, if the branches of your vines bee too neare the wall, the reflection of the Sunne in the day time, and the colde in the night, doe oftentimes ≈øpoile a great deale of fruit, by piercing and withering the tender foot-≈øtalkes of the grapes, before they are formed, whereas when the blo≈ø≈øomes are pa≈øt, and the fruit growing of ≈øome bigne≈ø≈øe, then all the heate and reflection you can giue them is fit, and therefore cut away ≈øome of the branches with the leaues, to admit the more Sunne to ripen the fruit. For the diuers ≈øorts of grapes I haue ≈øet them downe in the Booke following, with briefe notes vpon euerie of them, whether white or blacke, ≈ømall or great, early or late ripe; ≈øo that I neede not here make the ≈øame relation again. There doth happen ≈øome di≈øea≈øes to Vines ≈øometimes, which that you may helpe, I thinke it conuenient to informe you what they are, and how to remedy them when you ≈øhall be troubled with any ≈øuch. The fir≈øt is a luxurious ≈øpreading of branches and but little or no fruit: for remedie whereof, cut the branches ≈øomewhat more neere then v≈øuall, and bare the roote, but take heed of wounding or hurting it, and in the hole put either ≈øome good old rotten ≈øtable dung of Hor≈øes, of el≈øe ≈øome Oxe blood new taken from the bea≈øts, and that in the middle of Ianuarie or beginning of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, which being well tempered and turned in with the earth, let it ≈øo abide, which no doubt, when the comfort of the blood or dung is well ≈øoaked to the bottome by the raines that fall thereon, will cau≈øe your Vine to fructifie againe. Another fault is, when a Vine doth not bring the fruit to ripene≈ø≈øe, but either it withereth before it be growne of any bigne≈ø≈øe, or pre≈øently after the blooming: the place or the earth where ≈øuch a Vine ≈øtandeth, a≈ø≈øuredly is too cold, and therefore if the fault bee not in the place, which cannot bee helped without remouing to a better, digge out a good quantity of that earth, and put into the place thereof ≈øome good fre≈øh ground well heartned with dung, and ≈øome ≈øand mixed therewith (but not ≈øalt or ≈øalt water, as ≈øome doe adui≈øe, nor yet vrine, as others would haue) and this will hearten and ≈øtrengthen your Vine to beare out the frut vnto maturitie. When the leaues of a Vine in the end of Summer or in Autumne, vntimely doe turne either yellow or red, it is a great ≈øigne the earth is <pb n="554" facs="tcp:15790:284"/> too hot and drie; you mu≈øt therefore in ≈øtead of dung and ≈øand, as in the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is ≈øaid, put in ≈øome fre≈øh loame or ≈øhort clay, well mixed together with ≈øome of the earth, and ≈øo let them abide, that the fro≈øts may mellow them. And la≈øtly, a Vine ≈øometimes beareth ≈øome ≈øtore of grapes, but they are too many for it to bring to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe; you ≈øhall therefore helpe ≈øuch a Vine (which no doubt is of ≈øome excellent kinde, for they are mo≈øt v≈øually ≈øubiect to this fault) by nipping away the blo≈ø≈øomes from the branches, and leauing but one or two bunches at the mo≈øt vpon a branch, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Vine be growne older, and thereby ≈øtronger, and by this meane inured to beare out all the grapes to ripene≈ø≈øe. The≈øe be all the di≈øea≈øes I know doe happen to Vines: for the bleeding of a Vine it ≈øeldome happeneth of it ≈øelfe, but commeth either by cutting it vntimely, that is, too late in the yeare, (for after Ianuarie, if you will be well adui≈øed, cut not any Vine) or by ≈øome ca≈øuall or wilfull breaking of an arme or a branch. This bleeding in ≈øome is vnto death, in others it ≈øtayeth after a certaine ≈øpace of it ≈øelfe: To helpe this inconuenience, ≈øome haue ≈øeared the place where it bleedeth with an hot iron, which in many haue done but a little good; others haue bound the barke clo≈øe with packe-thred to ≈øtay it; and ≈øome haue tied ouer the place, being fir≈øt dried as well as may bee, a plai≈øter made with waxe ro≈ø≈øen and turpentine while it is warme. Now for the propagating of them: You mu≈øt take the faire≈øt and goale≈øt ≈øhot branches of one yeares growth, and cut them off with a peece of the old wood vnto it, and the≈øe being put into the ground before the end of Ianuarie at the furthe≈øt, will ≈øhoote forth, and take roote, and ≈øo become Vines of the ≈øame kinde from whence you tooke them. This is the mo≈øt ≈øpeedy way to haue increa≈øe: for the laying downe of branches to take roote, doth not yeelde ≈øuch ≈øtore ≈øo plentifully, nor doe ≈øuckers ri≈øe from the rootes ≈øo aboundantly; yet both the≈øe waies doe yeelde Vines, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from the old ≈øtockes will become young plants, fit to bee di≈øpo≈øed of as any ≈øhall thinke meete.</p>

                  <p>ALthough it bee common and v≈øuall in the parts beyond the Sea to dry their grapes in the Sunne, thereby to pre≈øerue them all the year, as the Rai≈øins of the Sunne are, which cannot bee done in our Countrie for the want of ≈øufficient heate thereof at that time: or otherwi≈øe to ≈øcald them in hot water (as I heare) and afterwards to dry them, and ≈øo keepe them all the yeare, as our Malaga Rai≈øins are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared that are packed vp into Frayles: yet I doe intend to ≈øhew you ≈øome other waies to pre≈øerue the grapes of our Countrie fre≈øh, that they may be eaten in the winter both before and after Chri≈øtmas with as much delight and plea≈øure almo≈øt, as when they were new gathered. One way is, when you haue gathered your grapes you intend to keepe, which mu≈øt be in a dry time, and that all the ≈øhrunke, dried, or euill grapes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery bunch be picked away, and hauing prouided a ve≈ø≈øell to hold them, be it of wood or ≈øtone which you will, and a ≈øufficient quantitie of faire and cleane drie ≈øand; make <hi>≈øtratum ≈øuper ≈øtratum</hi> of your grapes and the ≈øand, that is, a lay of ≈øand in the bottome fir≈øt, and a lay of grapes vpon them, and a lay or ≈øtrowing againe of ≈øand vpon tho≈øe grapes, ≈øo that the ≈øand may couer euery lay of grapes a fingers breadth in thickne≈ø≈øe, which being done one vpon another vntill the ve≈ø≈øell be full, and a lay of ≈øand vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt, let the ve≈ø≈øell be ≈øtopped clo≈øe, and ≈øet by vntill you plea≈øe to ≈øpend them, being kept in ≈øome drie place and in no ≈øellar: let them bee wa≈øhed cleane in faire water to take away the ≈øand from ≈øo many you will ≈øpend at a time. Another way is (which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarius ≈øetteth downe he was informed the Turkes v≈øe to keepe grapes all the winter vnto the next ≈øummer) to take ≈øo much meale of Mu≈øtard ≈øeede, as will ≈øerue to ≈øtrow vpon grapes, vntill they haue filled their ve≈ø≈øels, whereon afterwards they poure new wine before it hath boiled, to fill vp their ve≈ø≈øels therwith, and being ≈øtopped vp clo≈øe, they keepe them a certaine time, and ≈øelling them with their liquour to them that will
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:15790:284"/> v≈øe them, they doe wa≈øh the ≈øeedes or meale from them when they v≈øe them. Another way is, that hauing gathered the faire≈øt ripe grapes, they are to be ca≈øt vpon threds or ≈øtrings that are fa≈øtened at both ends to the ≈øide walks of a chamber, neere vnto the ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof, that no one bunch touch another, which will bee ≈øo kept a great while, yet the chamber mu≈øt be well defended from the fro≈øts, and cold windes that pierce in at the windowes, le≈øt they peri≈øh the ≈øooner: and ≈øome will dippe the ends of the branches they hang vp fir≈øt in molten pitch, thinking by ≈øearing vp the ends to keepe the bunches the better; but I doe not ≈øee any great likelihood therein. Your chamber or clo≈øet you appoint out for this purpo≈øe mu≈øt al≈øo bee kept ≈øomewhat warme, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially in the more cold and fro≈øtie time of the yeare, le≈øt it ≈øpoile all your co≈øt and paines, and fru≈øtrate you of all your hopes: but although the fro≈øts ≈øhould pierce and ≈øpoile ≈øome of the grapes on a bunch, yet if you be carefull to keepe the place warme, the fewer will be ≈øpoiled. And thus haue I ≈øhewed you the be≈øt directions to order this Orchard rightly, and all the waies I know are v≈øed in our Countrie to keep grapes good anie long time after the gathering, in regard wee haue not that comfort of a hotter Sun to pre≈øerue them by its heate.</p>

                  <p>The red Curran bu≈øh is of two ≈øorts, and groweth to the height of a man, hauing ≈øometimes a ≈øtemme of two inches thickne≈ø≈øe, and diuers armes and branches, couered with a ≈ømooth, darke, browni≈øh barke, without anie pricke or thorne at all vpon anie part thereof, whereon doe growe large cornered blacki≈øh greene leaues, cut in on the edges, ≈øeeming to be made of fiue parts, almo≈øt like a Vine leafe, the ends a little poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, and ≈øtanding one aboue another on both ≈øides of the branches: the flowers are little and hollow, comming forth at the ioynts of the leaues, growing many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on a long ≈øtalke, hanging downe aboue a fingers length, and of an herbie colour: after which come ≈ømall round fruit or berries, greene at the fir≈øt, and red as a Cherry when they are ripe, of a plea≈øant and tart ta≈øte: the other differeth not in anie other thing then in the berries, being twice as bigge as the former: the roote is wooddy, and ≈øpreadeth diuer≈øly.</p>

<hi>Goo≈øeberries or Feaberries.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WEe haue diuers ≈øorts of Goo≈øeberries, be≈øides the common kinde, which is of three ≈øorts, ≈ømall, great, and long. For wee haue three red Goo≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, a blew and a greene.</p>
                  <p>The common Goo≈øeberrie, or Feaberrie bu≈øh, as it is called in diuers Countries of England, hath oftentimes a great ≈øtemme, couered with a ≈ømooth darke coloured bark, without anie thorne thereon, but the elder branches haue here and there ≈øome on them, and the younger are whiti≈øh, armed with verie ≈øharpe and cruell crooked thorns, which no mans hand can well auoide that doth handle them, whereon are ≈øet verie greene and ≈ømall cornered leaues cut in, of the fa≈øhion almo≈øt of Smallage, or Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne leaues, but broad at the ≈øtalke: the flowers come forth ≈øingle, at euerie ioynt of the leafe one or two, of a purpli≈øh greene colour, hollow and turning vp the brims a little: the berries follow, bearing the flowers on the heads of them, which are of a pale greene at the fir≈øt, and of a greeni≈øh yellow colour when they are ripe, ≈øtriped in diuers places, and cleare, almo≈øt tran≈øparent, in which the ≈øeede lyeth. In ≈øome the≈øe berries are ≈ømall and round; in others much greater; a third is great, but longer then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: all of them haue a plea≈øant winie ta≈øte, acceptable to the ≈øtomacke of anie (but the long kinde hath both the thicker skin, and the wor≈øer ta≈øte of the other) and none haue been di≈øtempered by the eating of them, that euer I could heare of.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt of the red Goo≈øeberries is better knowne I thinke then the re≈øt, and by rea≈øon of the ≈ømall bearing not much regarded; the ≈øtemme is ≈øomewhat bigge, and couered with a ≈ømooth darke coloured barke, the younger branches are whiter, and without anie thorne or pricke at all, ≈øo long, weake, ≈ømall, and ≈ølender, that they lye vpon the ground, and will there roote againe: the leaues are like vnto the former Goo≈øeberries, but larger: the flowers and berries ≈øtand ≈øingle, and not manie to bee found anie yeare vpon them, but are ≈øomewhat long, and are as great as the ordinarie Goo≈øeberry, of a darke browni≈øh red colour, almo≈øt blacki≈øh when they are ripe, and of a ≈øweeti≈øh ta≈øte, but without any great delight.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øecond red Goo≈øeberry ri≈øeth vp with a more ≈øtraight ≈øtemme, couered with a browni≈øh barke; the young branches are ≈øtraight likewi≈øe, and whiti≈øh, and grow not ≈øo thicke vpon it as the former red kinde, and without any thorne al≈øo vpon them: the leaues are like vnto the former red, but ≈ømaller: the berries ≈øtand ≈øingly at the leaues as Goo≈øeberries doe, and are of a fine red colour when they are ripe, but change with ≈øtanding to be of a darker red colour, of the bigne≈ø≈øe of the ≈ømall ordinary Goo≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, of a pretty tart ta≈øte, and ≈øomewhat ≈øweete withall.</p>
                  <p>The third red Goo≈øeberry which is the greate≈øt, and knowne but vnto few, is ≈øo like vnto the common great Goo≈øeberry, that it is hardly di≈øtingui≈øhed: the fruit or berries grow as plentifully on the branches as the ordinary, and are as great &amp; round as the great ordinary kinde, but reddi≈øh, and ≈øome of them paler, with red ≈øtripes.</p>
                  <p>The blew Goo≈øeberry ri≈øeth vp to bee a bu≈øh like vnto the red Curran, and of the ≈øame bigne≈ø≈øe and height, with broader and redder leaues at the fir≈øt ≈øhooting out, then the ≈øecond red Goo≈øeberry: the berries are more ≈øparingly ≈øet on the branches, then on the ≈ømall red, and much about the ≈øame bigne≈ø≈øe, or rather le≈ø≈øer, of the colour of a Dam≈øon, with an ouer≈øhadowing of a blewi≈øh colour vpon them, as the Dam≈øon hath, before it be handled or wiped away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="561" facs="tcp:15790:287"/>The greene prickly Goo≈øeberry is very like vnto the ordinary Goo≈øeberry in ≈øtemme and branches, but that they are not ≈øtored with ≈øo many ≈øharpe prickles; but the young ≈øhootes are more plentifull in ≈ømall prickles about, and the greene leafe is a little ≈ømaller: the flowers are alike, and ≈øo are the berries, being of a middle ≈øize, and not very great, greene when they are thorough ripe as well as before, but mellower, and hauing a few ≈ømall ≈øhort prickles, like ≈ømall ≈øhort haires vpon them, which are harmle≈ø≈øe, and without danger to anie the mo≈øt dainty and tender palate that is, and of a verie good plea≈øant ta≈øte.

                     <p>The berries of the ordinary Goo≈øeberries, while they are ≈ømall, greene, and hard, are much v≈øed to bee boyled or ≈øcalded to make ≈øawce, both for fi≈øh and fle≈øh of diuers ≈øorts, for the ≈øicke ≈øometimes as well as the ≈øound, as al≈øo before they be neere ripe, to bake into tarts, or otherwi≈øe, after manie fa≈øhions, as the cunning of the Cooke, or the plea≈øure of his commanders will appoint.

                  <p>There is (as it is thought) another kinde, who≈øe berries are thrice as bigge as the former, which I confe≈ø≈øe I haue not ≈øeene, and know not whether it be true or no: for it may peraduenture be but the ≈øame, the goodne≈ø≈øe of the ground and ayre where they growe, and the youngne≈ø≈øe of the bu≈øhes cau≈øing that largene≈ø≈øe, as I haue ob≈øerued in the ≈øame kinde, to yeeld greater berries.</p>

One de≈øcription therefore ≈øhall ≈øerue (as I v≈øe to doe in ≈øuch varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) for all the re≈øt, with the names afterwards, of as many as we can giue, and the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall formes, colours and proportions of the grapes.</p>
                  <p>The manured Vine, in the places where it hath abiden long time, groweth to haue a great bodie, ≈øtemme or trunke, ≈øometimes of the bigne≈ø≈øe of a mans arme, ≈øleeue and all, ≈øpreading branches if it bee ≈øuffered without end or mea≈øure, but v≈øually ≈øtored with many armes or branches, both old and new, but weake, and therefore mu≈øt bee ≈øu≈øtained; whereof the old are couered with a thin ≈øcaly rinde, which will often chap and peele off of it ≈øelfe; the younge≈øt being of a reddi≈øh colour, ≈ømooth and firme, with a hollowne≈ø≈øe or pith in the middle: from the ioints of the young branches, and ≈øometimes from the bodie of the elder, breake out on euerie ≈øide broade greene leaues, cut on the edges into fiue diui≈øions for the mo≈øt part, and be≈øides notched or den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about: right again≈øt the leafe, and likewi≈øe at other ioynts of the branches, come forth long twining or cla≈øping tendrels, winding them≈øelues about any thing ≈øtandeth next vnto them: at the bottome of the≈øe leaues come forth clu≈øters of ≈ømall greeni≈øh yellow bloomes or flowers, and after them the berries, growing in the ≈øame manner in clu≈øters, but of diuers formes, colours, ta≈øtes and greatne≈ø≈øe. For ≈øome grapes are great, others le≈ø≈øe, ≈øome very ≈ømall (as the Currans that the Grocers ≈øell) ≈øome white, ≈øome red, blew, blacke, or partie-coloured, ≈øome are are as it were ≈øquare, others round: ≈øome the clu≈øters are clo≈øe, others open, ≈øome are ≈øweete, others ≈øower or har≈øh, or of ≈øome other mixed ta≈øte; euerie one differing from others, verie notably either in ta≈øte, colour or forme; within euerie one of which grapes, (and yet there is a grape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øtones) are contained one, two, or more kernels or ≈øtones, ≈øome of them being ≈ømal, others greater: the rootes ≈øpread far and deepe.

                     <p>Our ordinarie Grape both white and red, which excelleth Crabs for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuice, and is not fit for wine with vs.</p>
                     <p>The white Mu≈øcadine Grape is a verie great Grape, ≈øweete and firme, ≈øome of the bunches haue weighed ≈øixe pound, and ≈øome of the grapes halfe an ounce.</p>
                     <p>The redde Mu≈øcadine is as great as the white, and chiefly differeth in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>The Burlet is a very great white Grape, but fitter for veriuice then wine for the mo≈øt part; yet when a hot yeare happeneth fit for it, the Grape is plea≈øant.</p>
                     <p>The little blacke Grape that is ripe very early.</p>
                     <p>The Rai≈øin of the Sunne Grape is a very great Grape, and very great clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters, of a reddi≈øh colour when it is ripe with vs, yet in an extraordinarie hot yeare, it hath got a little blewne≈ø≈øe ca≈øt ouer it by the heat: but naturally verie blew.</p>
                     <p>The Curran Grape (or the Grape of Corinth) is the lea≈øt Grape of all, and beareth both few, and verie ≈øeldome with vs, but in rea≈øonable great clu≈øters, and of a blacki≈øh blew colour, when they are ripe with vs, and very <pb n="564" facs="tcp:15790:289"/> ≈øweete. There is another ≈øort of them that are red or browne, and of a ≈øow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ta≈øte, nothing ≈øo ≈øweete.</p>
                     <p>The Greeke wine Grape is a blacki≈øh Grape, and very ≈øweete.</p>
                     <p>The Frontignack is a white Grape, of a verie ≈øweete and delicate ta≈øte, as the wine declareth, that ≈ømelleth as it were of Muske.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øquare Grape is reported to bear a Grape not fully round, but ≈øided, or as it were ≈øquare, whereby it became ≈øo called.</p>
                     <p>The Dama≈øco Grape is a great white grape, very ≈øweete, and is the true <hi>Vva Zibeba,</hi> that the Apothecaries ≈øhould v≈øe in the <hi>Trochi≈øci Ciphi:</hi> and ≈øuch wee haue had in former times come ouer vnto vs in great, long and round white boxes, containing halfe an hundred weight a peece.</p>
                     <p>The Ru≈ø≈øet Grape is a rea≈øonable faire grape, exceeding ≈øweet and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh, with a thicke skinne, cru≈øted ouer with a ≈øhew of a≈øh colour.</p>
                     <p>The white long Grape is like vnto a Pigeons egge, or as it were pointed pendent like a Pearle.</p>
                     <p>The partie-coloured Grape is a rea≈øonable great Grape, and di≈øcoloured when it is ripe, ≈øometimes the whole bunches, and ≈øometimes but ≈øome of the grapes being parted whiti≈øh, and blacke halfe through, verie variably.</p>
                     <p>The Rheni≈øh wine Grape is a white Grape, and endureth the cold of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when it commeth earely, more then the Mu≈øcadine before ≈øet downe, and is nothing ≈øo ≈øweete.</p>
                     <p>The White wine Grape is verie like vnto the Rhine Grape, the ≈øoile only and climate adding more ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe vnto the one then to the other.</p>
                     <p>The Claret wine Grape is altogether like the white Grape, but that it is not white, but of a reddi≈øh colour, which lying brui≈øed vpon the skins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are pre≈ø≈øed, giue that Claret tincture to the wine.</p>
                     <p>The Teint is a Grape of a deeper or darker colour, who≈øe iuice is of ≈øo deepe a colour, that it ≈øerueth to colour other wine.</p>
                     <p>The Bur≈øarobe is a faire ≈øweete white Grape of much e≈øteeme about Paris.</p>
                     <p>The Alligant is a verie ≈øweete Grape, giuing ≈øo deep and liuely a coloured red wine, that no other what≈øoeuer is comparable to it, and therfore v≈øually called Spaniards blood.</p>
                     <p>The blew or blacke Grape of Orleans is another blacke Grape, giuing a darke coloured ≈øweete wine much commended in tho≈øe parts.</p>
                     <p>The Grape without ≈øtones is al≈øo a kinde by it ≈øelfe, and groweth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neere A≈øcalon, as Brochard affirmeth, the wine whereof is redde, and of a good ta≈øte.</p>
                     <p>The Virginia Vine, whereof I mu≈øt needes make mention among other Vines, beareth ≈ømall Grapes without any great ≈øtore of iuice therein, and the ≈øtone within it bigger then in any other Grape: naturally it runneth on the ground, and beareth little.</p>

I will therefore endeauour after one generall de≈øcription (as my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtome is in many other the like variable fruits) to giue as briefe and ≈øhort notes vpon all the re≈øt, as I can both for leafe and fruit, that ≈øo you may the better know what the fruit is, when you haue the name.</p>
                  <p>The Engli≈øh Cherrie tree groweth in time to be of a rea≈øonable bigne≈ø≈øe and height, ≈øpreading great armes, and al≈øo ≈ømall twiggy branches plentifully; the leaues whereof are not varie large or long, but nicked or dented about the edges: the flowers come forth two or three or foure at the mo≈øt together, at a knot or ioynt, euerie one by it ≈øelfe, vpon his owne ≈ømall and long foote≈øtalke, con≈øi≈øting of fiue white leaues, with ≈øome threds in the middle; after which come round berries, greene at the fir≈øt, and red when they are through ripe, of a meane bigne≈ø≈øe, and of a plea≈øant ≈øweete ta≈øte, ≈øomew hat tart withall, with a hard white ≈øtone within it, who≈øe kernell is ≈øomewhat bitter, but not vnplea≈øant.</p>
                  <p>The Flanders Cherrie differeth not from the Engli≈øh, but that it is ≈øomewhat larger, and the Cherry ≈øomewhat greater and ≈øweeter, and not ≈øo ≈øower.</p>
                  <p>The early Flanders Cherry is more rathe or early ripe, almo≈øt as ≈øoone as the May Cherry, e≈øpecially planted again≈øt a wall, and of many fal≈øe knaues or Gardiners are ≈øold for May Cherrie trees.</p>
                  <p>The May Cherrie in a ≈øtandard beareth ripe fruite later then planted again≈øt a wall, where the berries will be red in the verie beginning of May ≈øometimes.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Dukes Cherrie is one of the faire≈øt and be≈øt cherries wee haue, being of a very red colour when it is ripe, and a little long more then round, and ≈øomewhat poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the end, of the be≈øt relli≈øh of any Cherrie what≈øoeuer, and of a firme ≈øub≈øtance; ≈øcarce one of twentie of our Nur≈øerie men doe ≈øell the right, but giue one for another: for it is an inherent qualitie almo≈øt hereditarie with mo≈øt of them, to ≈øell any man an ordinary fruit for what≈øoeuer rare fruit he ≈øhall aske for: ≈øo little they are to be tru≈øted.</p>
                  <p>The ounce Cherrie hath the greate≈øt and broade≈øt leafe of any other cherrie, but beareth the ≈ømalle≈øt ≈øtore of cherries euerie yeare that any doth, and yet blo≈ø≈øometh well: the fruit al≈øo is nothing an≈øwerable to the name being not verie great, of a pale yellowi≈øh red, neere the colour of Amber, and therefore ≈øome haue called it, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Cherrie.</p>
                  <p>The great leafed Cherrie is thought of diuers to bee the Ounce Cherrie, becau≈øe it hath almo≈øt as great a leafe as the former: but the fruit of this al≈øo doth not an≈øwer the expectation of ≈øo great a leafe, being but of a meane bigne≈ø≈øe, and a ≈ømall bearer, yet of a pale reddi≈øh colour.</p>
                  <p>The true Ga≈øcoign Cherry is known but to a few; for our Nur≈øery men do ≈øo change the names of mo≈øt fruits they ≈øell, that they deliuer but very few true names to any: In former times before our wilde blacke Cherrie was found to grow plentifully in our owne woods in many places of this Land, the French continually ≈øtored vs with wilde ≈øtockes to graft vpon, which then were called Ga≈øcoigne ≈øtocks, but ≈øince they haue ≈øo
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:15790:293"/> termed another red Cherrie, and obtruded it vpon their cu≈øtomers: but the true is one of our late ripe white Cherries, euen as Gerard ≈øaith, it is a great cherrie and ≈øpotted: and this is that Cherrie I ≈øo commend to be a fit ≈øtocke to graft May cherries vpon.</p>
                  <p>The Morello Cherrie is of a rea≈øonable bigne≈ø≈øe, of a darke red colour when they are full ripe, and hang long on, of a ≈øweeti≈øh ≈øower ta≈øte, the pulpe or ≈øub≈øtance is red, and ≈øomewhat firme: if they be dryed they will haue a fine ≈øharpe or ≈øower ta≈øte very delectable.</p>
                  <p>The Hartlippe Cherrie is ≈øo called of the place where the be≈øt of this kinde is nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed vp, being betweene Sitting bourne and Chattam in Kent, and is the bigge≈øt of our Engli≈øh kindes.</p>
                  <p>The ≈ømaller Lacure or Hart Cherrie is a rea≈øonable faire Cherrie, full aboue, and a little pointing downward, after the fa≈øhion of an heart, as it is v≈øually painted, blacki≈øh when it is full ripe, and le≈ø≈øer then the next.</p>
                  <p>The great Lacure or Hart Cherrie differeth not in forme, but in greatne≈ø≈øe, being v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øually twice as great as the former, and of a reddi≈øh blacke colour al≈øo: both of them are of a firme ≈øub≈øtance, and rea≈øonable ≈øweete. Some doe call the white cherrie, the White hart cherrie.</p>
                  <p>The Luke Wardes Cherrie hath a rea≈øonable large leafe, and a larger flower then many other: the cherries grow with long ≈øtalkes, and a ≈øtone of a meane ≈øize within them, of a darke reddi≈øh colour when they are full ripe, of a rea≈øonable good relli≈øh, and beareth well.</p>
                  <p>The Corone Cherrie hath a leafe little differing from the Luke Wardes cherrie; the fruit when it is ripe, is of a faire deepe red colour, of a good bigne≈ø≈øe, and of a verie good ta≈øte, neither verie ≈øweete or ≈øower: the pulpe or iuice will ≈øtaine the hands.</p>
                  <p>The Vrinall Cherrie in a mo≈øt fruitfull yeare is a ≈ømall bearer, hauing many yeares none, and the be≈øt but a few; yet doth blo≈ø≈øome plentifully euery yeare for the mo≈øt part: the cherrie is long and round, like vnto an Vrinall, from whence it tooke his name; reddi≈øh when it is full ripe, and of an indifferent ≈øweete relli≈øh.</p>
                  <p>The Agriot Cherrie is but a ≈ømall Cherrie, of a deepe redde colour when it is ripe, which is late; of a fine ≈øharpe ta≈øte, mo≈øt plea≈øant and whol≈øome to the ≈øtomacke of all other cherries, as well while they are fre≈øh as being dryed, which manner they much v≈øe in France, and keepe them for the v≈øe both of the ≈øicke and ≈øound at all times.</p>
                  <p>The Biguarre Cherrie is a fair cherrie, much ≈øpotted with white ≈øpots vpon the pale red berry, and ≈øometimes di≈øcoloured halfe white and halfe reddi≈øh, of a rea≈øonable good relli≈øh.</p>
                  <p>The Morocco Cherrie hath a large white blo≈ø≈øome, and an indifferent big berrie, long and round, with a long ≈øtalke of a darke reddi≈øh purple colour, a little tending to a blew when it is full ripe, of a firme ≈øub≈øtance: the iuice is of a blacki≈øh red, di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring the hands or lips, and of a plea≈øant ta≈øte: Some doe thinke that this and the Morello be both one.</p>
                  <p>The Naples Cherrie is al≈øo thought to bee all one with the Morello or Morocco.</p>
                  <p>The white Spani≈øh Cherrie is an indifferent good bearer, the leafe and blo≈ø≈øome ≈øomewhat large, and like the Luke Wardes cherrie: the cherries are rea≈øonable faire berries, with long ≈øtalkes and great ≈øtones, white on the out≈øide, with ≈øome redne≈ø≈øe, on the one ≈øide of a firme ≈øub≈øtance, and rea≈øonable ≈øweet, but with a little aciditie, and is one of the late ripe ones: But there is another late ripe white Cherry, which ≈øome call the Ga≈øcoigne, before remembred.</p>
                  <p>The Flanders clu≈øter Cherrie is of two ≈øorts, one greater then another: the greater kinde hath an indifferent large leafe; the blo≈ø≈øomes haue many threds within them, ≈øhewing as it were many parts, which after turne into clu≈øters of berries, foure, fiue or ≈øixe together, and but with one ≈øtalke vnder them, as if they grew one out of another, and ≈øometimes they will beare but two or three, and mo≈øt of them but one cherry on a ≈øtalke, which are red when they are ripe, very tender, and wateri≈øh ≈øweete in eating.</p>
                  <p>The le≈ø≈øer is in all things like the greater, but ≈ømaller, which maketh the difference.</p>
                  <p>The wilde clu≈øter or birds clu≈øter Cherry beareth many blo≈ø≈øomes ≈øet all along the ≈øtalkes, and cherries after them in the ≈øame maner, like long thinne bunch of grapes, and therefore called of ≈øome the Grape cherry: there are of them both red and blacke.</p>

                     <pb n="574" facs="tcp:15790:294"/>The ≈øoft ≈øheld Cherrie is a ≈ømall red cherrie when it is ripe, hauing the ≈øtone within it ≈øo ≈øoft and tender, that it may ea≈øily be broken in the eating of the cherrie.</p>
                  <p>Iohn Trade≈øcantes Cherrie is mo≈øt v≈øually ≈øold by our Nur≈øery Gardiners, for the Archdukes cherrie, becau≈øe they haue more plenty thereof, and will better be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, and becau≈øe it is ≈øo faire and good a cherrie that it may be obtruded without much di≈øcontent: it is a rea≈øonable good bearer, a faire great berrie, deepe coloured, and a little pointed.</p>
                  <p>The Baccalaos or New-found-land Cherrie hath a ≈øhining long leafe, mo≈øt like vnto a Peach lea≈øe, the blo≈ø≈øomes come very many together as it werein an vmbell, which is ≈øuch a clu≈øter as is neither like the Flanders clu≈øter, nor the wilde clu≈øter cherrie blo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome: it bringeth forth berries ≈øtanding in the ≈øame manner euerie one vpon his own foote≈øtalke, being no bigger then the large≈øt berrie of the red Curran tree or bu≈øh, of a pale or wateri≈øh red colour when it is ripe.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øtrange long clu≈øter Cherrie, or <hi>Padus Theophrasti Dalechampio</hi> is reckoned by the Author of that great Herball that goeth vnder his name, among the ≈øorts of cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and ≈øo mu≈øt I vntill a fitter place be found for it. It groweth in time to be a great tree, with a ≈øad coloured barke both on the bodie and branches, whereon doe grow many leaues, ≈øomewhat broade, ≈øhorter, harder, and a little more crumpled then any cherrie leafe: the blo≈ø≈øomes are very ≈ømall, and of a pale or whiti≈øh colour, ≈ømelling very ≈øweete and ≈øtrong, or rather heady, like Orenge flowers, growing on ≈ømall long branches, very like the toppe of flowers vpon the Laburnum or Beane trefoile trees: after which come ≈ømall blacke berries, growing together all along the long ≈øtalke, like vnto the wilde clu≈øter or birds cherrie mentioned before, but not much bigger then tares, with ≈ømall ≈øtones within them, and little or no ≈øu≈øtance vpon them: the French call the tree <hi>Putier,</hi> becau≈øe the wood thereof ≈øtinketh, and make it to be wonderfull that the blo≈ø≈øomes of the tree ≈øhould be ≈øo ≈øweete, and the wood ≈øo ≈øtinking.</p>
                  <p>The Cullen Cherrie is a darke red cherrie like the Agriot, which they of tho≈øe parts neere Cullen and Vtrecht &amp;c. v≈øe to put into their drinke, to giue it the deeper colour.</p>
                  <p>The great Hungarian Cherrie of Zwerts is like both in leafe and fruite vnto the Morello cherrie, but much greater and fairer, and a far better bearer: for from a ≈ømall branch hath beene gathered a pound of cherries, and this is v≈øuall continually, and not accidentally, mo≈øt of them foure inches in compa≈ø≈øe about, and very many of them more of a faire deepe red colour, and very ≈øweete, excelling the Arch-Dukes cherry, or any other what≈øoeuer.</p>
                  <p>The Cameleon or ≈øtrange changeable Cherry de≈øeruedly hath this name, although of mine owne impo≈øition, not only becau≈øe it beareth v≈øually both blo≈ø≈øomes, greene and ripe fruit at one time thereupon, but that the fruit will be of many formes; ≈øome round, ≈øome as it were ≈øquare, and ≈øome bunched forth on one ≈øide or another, abiding con≈øtant in no fa≈øhion, but for the mo≈øt part ≈øhewing forth all the≈øe diuer≈øities euerie yeare growing vpon it: the fruit is of a very red colour, and good ta≈øte.</p>
                  <p>The great Ro≈øe Cherry, or double blo≈ø≈øomd Cherry differeth not in anything from the Engli≈øh Cherrie, but only in the blo≈ø≈øomes, which are very thicke of white leaues, as great and double as the double white Crowfoote, before remembred, and ≈øomtimes out of the middle of them will ≈øpring another ≈ømaller flower, but double al≈øo; this ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome beareth fruit, but when it doth I ≈øuppo≈øe it commeth from tho≈øe blo≈ø≈øomes are the lea≈øt double, and is red, no bigger then our ordinary Engli≈øh cherrie.</p>
                  <p>The le≈ø≈øer Ro≈øe or double blo≈ø≈øomd Cherrie beareth double flowers al≈øo, but not ≈øo thicke and double as the former; but beareth fruit more plentifully, of the ≈øame colour and bigne≈ø≈øe with the former.</p>
                  <p>The Dwarfe Cherrie is of two ≈øorts; one who≈øe branches fall downe low, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the body of it, with ≈ømall greene leaues, and fruit as ≈ømall, of a deep red colour.</p>
                  <p>The other, who≈øe branches, although ≈ømall, grow more vpright, hauing greener ≈øhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning leaues: the fruit is little bigger then the former, red al≈øo when it is ripe, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle point at the end: both of them of a ≈øweetith relli≈øh, but more ≈øower.</p>
                  <p>The great bearing Cherry of Ma≈øter Millen is a rea≈øonable great red cherry, bearing very plentifully, although it bee planted again≈øt a North wall, yet it will bee late ripe, but of an indifferent ≈øweet and good relli≈øh.</p>
                  <p>The long finger Cherry is another ≈ømall long red one, being long &amp; round like a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wherof it took the name: this is not the Vrinall cherry before, but differing from it.</p>

                     <hi>Prunus.</hi> The Plumme tree.</head>
                  <p>THere are many more varieties of Plummes then of Cherries, ≈øo that I mu≈øt follow the ≈øame order with the≈øe that I did with them, euen giue you their names apart, with briefe notes vpon them, and one de≈øcription to ≈øerue for all the re≈øt. And in this recitall I ≈øhall leaue out the Apricockes which are certainly a kind of Plum, of an e≈øpeciall difference, and not of a Peach, as Galen and ≈øome others haue thought, and ≈øet them in a chapter by them≈øelues, and only in this ≈øee down tho≈øe fruits are v≈øually called Plums.</p>
                  <p>The Plum tree (e≈øpecially diuers of them) ri≈øeth in time to bee a rea≈øonable tall and great tree, who≈øe bodie and greater armes are couered with a more rugged barke, yet in ≈øome more or le≈ø≈øe, the younger branches being ≈ømooth in all, the leaues are ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rounder then tho≈øe of the Cherrie tree, and much differing among them≈øelues, ≈øome being longer, or larger, or rounder then others, and many that are exerci≈øed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, can tell by the leafe what Plum the tree beareth (I ≈øpeake this of many, not of all) as in many Cherries they can doe the like: the flowers are white, con≈øi≈øting of fiue leaues: the fruit is as variable in forme, as in ta≈øte or colour, ≈øome being ovall or Peare fa≈øhion or Almond like, or ≈øphericall or round, ≈øome firme, ≈øome ≈øoft and wateri≈øh, ≈øome ≈øweete, ≈øome ≈øower or har≈øh, or differing from all the≈øe ta≈øtes: and ≈øome white, others blacke, ≈øome red, others yellow, ≈øome purple, others blew, as they ≈øhall bee briefly ≈øet downe vnto you in the following lines, where I meane not to in≈øert any the wilde or hedge fruit, but tho≈øe only are fit for an Orchard, to be ≈øtored with good fruit: and of all which ≈øorts, the choy≈øe≈øt for goodne≈ø≈øe, and rare≈øt for knowledge, are to be had of my very good friend Ma≈øter Iohn Trade≈øcante, who hath wonderfully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to obtaine all the rare≈øt fruits hee can heare off in any place of Chri≈øtendome, Turky, yea or the whole world; as al≈øo with Ma≈øter Iohn Millen, dwelling in Olde ≈øtreete, who from Iohn Trade≈øcante and all others that haue had good fruit, hath ≈øtored him≈øelfe with the be≈øt only, and he can ≈øufficiently furni≈øh any.</p>
                  <p>The Amber Primordian Plumme is an indifferent faire Plumme, early ripe, of a pale yellowi≈øh colour, and of a wateri≈øh ta≈øte, not plea≈øing.</p>
                  <p>The red Primordian Plumme is of a rea≈øonable ≈øize, long and round, reddi≈øh on the out≈øide, of a more dry ta≈øte, and ripe with the fir≈øt ≈øorts in the beginning of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øt.</p>
                  <p>The blew Primordian is a ≈ømall plumme, almo≈øt like the Dama≈øcene, and is ≈øubiect to drop off from the tree before it be ripe.</p>
                  <p>The white Date Plum is no very good plum.</p>

                     <pb n="576" facs="tcp:15790:295"/>The red Date plumme is a great long red pointed plumme, and late ripe, little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the white.</p>

                  <p>THe Apricocke (as I ≈øaid) is without que≈øtion a kinde of Plumme, rather then a Peach, both the flower being white, and the ≈øtone of the fruit ≈ømooth al≈øo, like a Plumme, and yet becau≈øe of the excellencie of the fruit, and the difference therein from all other Plummes, I haue thought it meete to entreate thereof by it ≈øelfe, and ≈øhew you the varieties haue been ob≈øerued in the≈øe times.</p>
                  <p>The Apricocke tree ri≈øeth vp to a very great height, either ≈øtanding by it ≈øelfe (where it beareth not ≈øo kindly, and very little in our country) or planted again≈øt a wall, as it is mo≈øt v≈øuall, hauing a great ≈øtemme or body, and likewi≈øe many great armes or branches, couered with a ≈ømooth barke: the leaues are large, broad, and almo≈øt round, but pointed at the ends, and finely dented about the edges: the flowers are white, as the Plumme tree blo≈ø≈øomes, but ≈øomewhat larger, and rounder ≈øet: the fruit is round, with a cleft on the one ≈øide, ≈øomewhat like vnto a Peach, being of a yellowi≈øh colour as well on the in≈øide as out≈øide, of a firme or fa≈øt ≈øub≈øtance, and dry, not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moi≈øt in the eating, and very plea≈øant in ta≈øte, containing within it a broad and flat ≈øtone, ≈øomewhat round and ≈ømooth, not rugged as the Peach ≈øtone, with a plea≈øant ≈øweete kernell (yet ≈øome haue reported, that there is ≈øuch as haue their kernels bitter, which I did neuer ≈øee or know) and is ripe almo≈øt with our fir≈øt or earlie≈øt Plummes, and thereof it tooke the name of <hi>Pracox;</hi> and it may bee was the earlie≈øt of all others was then knowne, when that name was giuen.</p>
                  <p>The great Apricocke, which ≈øome call the long Apricocke, is the greate≈øt and faire≈øt of all the re≈øt.</p>
                  <p>The ≈ømaller Apricocke, which ≈øome call the ≈ømall round Apricocke, is thought to be ≈ømall, becau≈øe it fir≈øt ≈øprang from a ≈øtone: but that is not ≈øo; for the kinde it ≈øelfe being inoculated, will bee alwaies ≈ømall, and neuer halfe ≈øo faire and great as the former.</p>
                  <p>The white Apricocke hath his leaues more folded together, as if it were halfe dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: it beareth but ≈øeldome, and very few, which differ not from the ordinary, but in being more white, without any red when it is ripe.</p>
                  <p>The Ma≈øcoline Apricocke hath a finer greene leafe, and thinner then the former, and beareth very ≈øeldome any ≈øtore of fruit, which differeth in nothing from the fir≈øt, but that it is a little more delicate.</p>
                  <p>The long Ma≈øcoline Apricocke hath his fruit growing a little longer then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and differeth in nothing el≈øe.</p>
                  <p>The Argier Apricocke is a ≈ømaller fruit then any of the other, and yellow, but as ≈øweete and delicate as any of them, hauing a blacki≈øh ≈øtone within it, little bigger then a Lacure Cherry ≈øtone: this with many other ≈øorts Iohn Trade≈øcante brought with him returning from the Argier voyage, whither hee went voluntary with the Fleete, that went again≈øt the Pyrates in the yeare 1620.</p>

                  <p>The Man Peach is of two ≈øorts, the one longer then the other, both of them are good Peaches, but the ≈øhorter is the better relli≈øhed.</p>

                  <p>I Pre≈øume that the name <hi>Nuciper≈øica,</hi> doth mo≈øt rightly belong vnto that kinde of Peach, which we call Nectorins, and although they haue beene with vs not many yeares, yet haue they beene knowne both in Italy to Matthiolus, and others before him, who it ≈øeemeth knew no other then the yellow Nectorin, as Dalechampius al≈øo: But we at this day doe know fiue ≈øeuerall ≈øorts of Nectorins, as they ≈øhall be pre≈øently ≈øet downe; and as in the former fruits, ≈øo in this, I will giue you the de≈øcription of one, and briefe notes of the re≈øt.</p>
                  <p>The Nectorin is a tree of no great bigne≈ø≈øe, mo≈øt v≈øually le≈ø≈øer then the Peach tree, his body and elder boughes being whiti≈øh, the younger branches very red, whereon grow narrow long greene leaues, ≈øo like vnto Peach leaues, that none can well di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh them, vnle≈ø≈øe it be in this, that they are ≈øomewhat le≈ø≈øer: the blo≈ø≈øomes are all reddi≈øh, as the Peach, but one of a differing fa≈øhion from all the other, as I ≈øhall ≈øhew you by and by: the fruit that followeth is ≈ømaller, rounder, and ≈ømoother then Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, without any cleft on the ≈øide, and without any douny cotton or freeze at all; and
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:15790:298"/> herein is like vnto the outer greene rinde of the Wallnut, whereof as I am per≈øwaded it tooke the name, of a fa≈øt and firme meate, and very delicate in ta≈øte, e≈øpecially the be≈øt kindes, with a rugged ≈øtone within it, and a bitter kernell.</p>
                  <p>The Muske Nectorin, ≈øo called, be cau≈øe it being a kinde of the be≈øt red Nectorins, both ≈ømelleth and eateth as if the fruit were ≈øteeped in Muske: ≈øome thinke that this and the next Romane Nectorin are all one.</p>
                  <p>The Romane red Nectorin, or clu≈øter Nectorin, hath a large or great purpli≈øh blo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome, like vnto a Peach, reddi≈øh at the bottome on the out≈øide, and greeni≈øh within: the fruit is of a fine red colour on the out≈øide, and groweth in clu≈øters, two or three at a ioynt together, of an excellent good ta≈øte.</p>
                  <p>The ba≈øtard red Nectorin hath a ≈ømaller or pincking blo≈ø≈øome, more like threads then leaues, neither ≈øo large nor open as the former, and yellowi≈øh within at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome: the fruit is red on the out≈øide, and groweth neuer but one at a ioynt; it is a good fruit, but eateth a little more rawi≈øh then the other, euen when it is full ripe.</p>
                  <p>The yellow Nectorin is of two ≈øorts, the one an excellent fruit, mellow, and of a very good relli≈øh; the other hard, and no way comparable to it.</p>
                  <p>The greene Nectorin, great and ≈ømall; for ≈øuch I haue ≈øeene abiding con≈øtant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both planted in one ground: they are both of one goodne≈ø≈øe, and accounted with mo≈øt to be the be≈øtrelli≈øhed Nectorin of all others.</p>
                  <p>The white Nectorin is ≈øaid to bee differing from the other, in that it will bee more white on the out≈øide when it is ripe, then either the yellow or greene: but I haue not yet ≈øeene it.</p>

                  <p>The Apple tree for the mo≈øt part is neyther very high, great or ≈øtraight, but rather v≈øually boweth and ≈øpreadeth (although in ≈øome places it groweth fairer and ≈øtraighter then in others) hauing long and great armes or boughes, and from them ≈ømaller bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereon doe grow ≈øomewhat broade, and long greene leaues, nicked about the edges: the flowers are large and white, with blu≈øh coloured ≈øides, con≈øi≈øting of fiue leaues: the fruit (as I ≈øaid) is of diuers formes, colours and ta≈øtes, and likewi≈øe of a very variable durabilitie; for ≈øome mu≈øt be eaten pre≈øently after they are gathered, and they are for the mo≈øt part the earlie≈øt ripe; others will abide longer vpon the trees, before they bee fit to be gathered; ≈øome al≈øo will be ≈øo hard when others are gathered, that they will not be fit to be eaten, for one, two or three months after they bee gathered; and ≈øome will abide good but one, two or three moneths, and no more; and ≈øome will be be≈øt, after a quarter or halfe a yeares lying, vnto the end of that yeare or the next. The Paradi≈øe or dwarfe Apple tree groweth nothing ≈øo high as the former, and many times not much higher then a man may reach, hauing leaues and flowers altogether like the other, the fruit is a faire yellow Apple, and rea≈øonable great, but very light and ≈øpongy or loo≈øe, and of a bitteri≈øh ≈øweet ta≈øte, nothing plea≈øant. And the≈øe faults al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo <pb n="587" facs="tcp:15790:300"/> are incident vnto this tree, that both bodie and branches are much ≈øubiect vnto cancker, which will quickely eate it round, and kill it; be≈øides it will haue many bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or tuberous ≈øwellings in many places, which grow as it were ≈øcabby or tough, and will ≈øoone cau≈øe it to peri≈øh: the roote ≈øendeth forth many ≈øhootes and ≈øuck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this benefit may be had of it, to recompence the former faults, That being a dwarfe Tree, what≈øoeuer fruit ≈øhall bee grafted on it, will keepe the graft low like vnto it ≈øelfe, and yet beare fruit rea≈øonable well. And this is a pretty way to haue Pippins, Pomewaters, or any other ≈øort of Apples (as I haue had my ≈øelfe, and al≈øo ≈øeene with others) growing low, that if any will, they may make a hedge rowe of the≈øe low fruits, planted in an Orchard all along by a walke ≈øide: but take this Caueat, if you will auoide the danger of the cancker and knots, which ≈øpoile the tree, to graft it hard vnto the ground, that therby you may giue as little of the nature of the ≈øtock thereunto as po≈ø≈øibly you can, which wil vndoubtedly help it very much.</p>

                  <p>The Engli≈øh Quince is the ordinarie Apple Quince, ≈øet downe before, and is of ≈øo har≈øh a ta≈øte being greene, that no man can endure to eate it rawe, but eyther boyled, ≈øtewed, roa≈øted or baked; all which waies it is very good.</p>
                  <p>The Portingall Apple Quince is a great yellow Quince, ≈øeldome comming to bee whole and faire without chapping; this is ≈øo plea≈øant being fre≈øh gathered, that it may be eaten like vnto an Apple without offence.</p>
                  <p>The Portingall Peare Quince is not fit to be eaten rawe like the former, but mu≈øt be v≈øed after ≈øome of the waies the Engli≈øh Quince is appointed, and ≈øo it will make more dainty di≈øhes then the Engli≈øh, becau≈øe it is le≈ø≈øe har≈øh, will bee more tender, and take le≈ø≈øe ≈øugar for the ordering then the Engli≈øh kinde.</p>

                  <p>ALthough the Wallnut tree bee often planted in the middle of great Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, where by rea≈øon of his great ≈øpreading armes it taketh vp a great deale of roome, his ≈øhadow reaching farre, ≈øo that ≈øcarce any thing can well grow neare it; yet becau≈øe it is likewi≈øe planted in fit places or corners of Orchards, and that it beareth fruit or nuts, often brought to the table, e≈øpecially while they are fre≈øhe≈øt, ≈øweete≈øt, and fitte≈øt to be eaten, let not my Orchard want his company, or you the knowledge of it. Some doe thinke that there are many ≈øorts of them, becau≈øe ≈øome are much greater then others, and ≈øome longer then others, and ≈øome haue a more fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible ≈øhell then others; but I am certainly per≈øwaded, that the ≈øoyle and climate where they grow, are the whole and onely cau≈øe of the varieties and differences. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Virginia hath ≈øent vnto vs two ≈øorts of Wallnuts, the one blacke, the other white, whereof as yet wee haue no further knowledge. And I know that Clu≈øius reporteth, he tooke vp at a banquet a long Wallnut, differing in forme and tenderne≈ø≈øe of ≈øhell from others, which being ≈øet, grew and bore farre tenderer leaues then the other, and a little ≈ønipt about the edges, which (as I ≈øaid) might alter with the ≈øoyle and climate: and be≈øides you may ob≈øerue, that many of Clu≈øius differences are very nice, and ≈øo I leaue it.</p>
                  <p>The Wallnut tree groweth very high and great, with a large and thicke body or trunke, couered with a thicke clouen whiti≈øh greene barke, tending to an a≈øh-colour; the armes are great, and ≈øpread farre, breaking out into ≈ømaller branches, whereon doe grow long &amp; large leaues, fiue or ≈øeuen ≈øet together one again≈øt another, with an odde one at the end, ≈øomewhat like vnto A≈øhen leaues, but farre larger, and not ≈øo many on a ≈øtalke, ≈ømooth, and ≈øomewhat reddi≈øh at the fir≈øt ≈øpringing, and tender al≈øo, of a rea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable good ≈øent, but more ≈øtrong and headie when they growe old: the fruit or nut is great and round, growing clo≈øe to the ≈øtalkes of the leaues, either by couples or by <pb n="595" facs="tcp:15790:304"/> three ≈øet together, couered with a double ≈øhell, that is to ≈øay, with a greene thicke and ≈øoft outer rinde, and an inner hard ≈øhell, within which the white kernell is contained, couered with a thinne yellow rinde or peeling, which is more ea≈øily peeled away while it is greene then afterwards, and is as it were parted into foure quarters, with a thinne wooddy peece parting it at the head, very ≈øweete and plea≈øant while it is fre≈øh, and for a while after the gathering; but the elder they growe, the harder and more oily: the catkins or blowings are long and yellow, made of many ≈øcaly leaues ≈øet clo≈øe together, which come forth early in the Spring, and when they open and fall away, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ≈øtalkes ari≈øe certaine ≈ømall flowers, which turne into ≈øo many nuts.</p>

                     <p>The ≈ømall young nuts while they are tender, being pre≈øerued or candid, are v≈øed among other ≈øorts of candid fruits, that ≈øerue at banquets.</p>

                     <p>The di≈øtilled water of the huskes drunke with a little vinegar, if the fits growe hot and tedious, is an approued remedy for the ≈øame.</p>
