            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the ancient Heathens did appropriate the firſt inuention of the knowledge of Herbes, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of Phyſicke, ſome vnto <hi>Chiron</hi> the Centaure, and others vnto <hi>Apollo</hi> or
<hi>Aeculapius</hi> his ſonne; yet wee that are Chriſtians haue out of a better Schoole learned, that God, the Creator of Heauen and Earth, at the beginning when he created <hi>Adam,</hi> inspired him with the knowledge of all naturall things (which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsiuely deſcended to <hi>Noah</hi> afterwardes, and to his Posterity): for, as he was able to giue names to all the liuing Creatures, according to their ſeuerall natures; ſo no doubt but hee had alſo the knowledge, both what Herbes and Fruits were fit, eyther for Meate or Medicine, for Vſe or for Delight. And that <hi>Adam</hi> might exerciſe this knowledge, God planted a Garden for him to liue in, (wherein euen in his innocency he was to labour and ſpend his time) which hee ſtored with the best and choyſeſt Herbes and Fruits the earth could produce, that he might haue not onely for neceſsitie whereon to feede, but for pleaſure alſo; the place or garden called Paradiſe importing as much, and more plainly the words ſet downe in <hi>Geneſis</hi> the ſecond, which are theſe; <hi>Out of the ground the Lord God made to grow euerie tree pleaſant to the ſight and good for meate;</hi> and in the <hi>24.</hi> of
<hi>Numbers,</hi> the Parable of Balaam, mentioning the Aloe trees that God planted; and in other places if there were neede to recite them. But my purpoſe is onely to ſhew you, that Paradiſe was a place (whether you will call it a Garden, or Orchard, or both, no doubt of ſome large extent) wherein
<hi>Adam</hi> was firſt placed to abide; that God was the Planter thereof, hauing furniſhed it with trees and herbes, as well pleaſant to the ſight, as good for meate, and that hee being to dreſſe and keepe this place, muſt of neceſsity know all the things that grew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to what vſes they ſerued, or elſe his labour about them, and knowledge in them, had been in vaine. And although <hi>Adam</hi> lost the place for his tranſgreſsion, yet he loſt not the naturall knowledge, nor vſe of them: but that, as God made the whole world, and all the Creatures therein for Man, ſo hee may vſe all things as well of pleaſure as of neceſsitie, to bee helpes vnto him to ſerue his God. Let men therefore, according to their firſt inſtitution, ſo vſe their ſeruice, that they alſo in them may remember their ſeruice to God, and not (like our Grand-mother <hi>Eve</hi>) ſet their affections ſo ſtrongly on the pleaſure in them, as to deſerue the loſſe of them in this Paradiſe, yea and of Heauen alſo. For truly from all ſorts of Herbes and Flowers we may draw matter at all times not only to magnifie the Creator that hath giuen them ſuch diuerſities of formes, ſents and colours, that the moſt cunning
<pb facs="tcp:15790:4"/> Worke-man cannot imitate, and ſuch vertues and properties, that although wee know many, yet many more lye hidden and vnknowne, but many good inſtructions alſo to our ſelues: That as many herbes and flowers with their fragrant ſweete ſmels doe comfort, and as it were reuiue the ſpirits, and perfume a whole houſe; euen ſo ſuch men as liue vertuouſly, labouring to doe good, and profit the Church of God and the Common wealth by their paines or penne, doe as it were ſend forth a pleaſing ſauour of ſweet inſtructions, not only to that time wherein they liue, and are freſh, but being drye, withered and dead, ceaſe not in all after ages to doe as much or more. Many herbes and flowers that haue ſmall beautie or ſauour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, haue much more good vſe and vertue: ſo many men of excellent rare parts and good qualities doe lye hid vnknown and not reſpected, vntill time and vſe of them doe ſet forth their properties. Againe, many flowers haue a glorious ſhew of beauty and brauery, yet ſtinking in ſmell, or elſe of no other vſe: ſo many doe make a glorious oſtentation, and flouriſh in the world, when as if they ſtinke not horribly before God, and all good men, yet ſurely they haue no other vertue then their outſide to commend them, or leaue behind them. Some alſo riſe vp and appear like a Lilly among Thornes, or as a goodly Flower among many Weedes or Graſſe, eyther by their honourable authoritie, or eminence of learning or riches, whereby they excell others, and thereby may doe good to many. The frailty alſo of Mans life is learned by the ſoone fading of them before their flowring, or in their pride, or ſoone after, being either cropt by the hand of the ſpectator, or by a ſudden blaſt wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and parched, or by the reuolution of time decaying of it owne nature: as alſo that the faireſt flowers or fruits firſt ripe, are ſooneſt and firſt gathered. The mutabilitie alſo of ſtates and perſons, by this, that as where many goodly flowers &amp; fruits did grow this yeare and age, in another they are quite pulled or digged vp, and eyther weedes and graſſe grow in their place, or ſome building erected thereon, and their place is no more known. The Ciuill reſpects to be learned from them are many alſo: for the delight of the varieties both of formes, colours and properties of Herbes and Flowers, hath euer beene powerfull ouer dull, vnnurtured, ruſticke and ſauage people, led only by Natures inſtinct; how much
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> powerfull is it, or ſhould be in the mindes of generous perſons? for it may well bee ſaid, he is not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, that is not allured with this obiect. The ſtudy, knowledge, and trauel in them, as they haue been entertained of great Kings, Princes and Potentates, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to their Greatneſſe, or hinderance to their more ſerious and weighty Affaires: ſo no doubt vnto all that are capable thereof, it is not onely pleaſant, but profitable, by comforting the minde, ſpirits and ſenſes with an harmeleſſe delight, and by enabling the iudgement to conferre and apply helpe to many dangerous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes. It is alſo an Inſtructer in the verity of the genuine Plants of the Ancients, and a Correcter of the many errours whereunto the world by continuance hath bin diuerted, and almoſt therein fixed, by eradicating in time, and by degrees, the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious wilfulneſſe of many, who becauſe they were brought vp in their errours, are moſt vnwilling to leaue them without conſideration of the good or euill, the right or wrong, they draw on therewith. And for my ſelfe I may well ſay, that had not mine owne paines and ſtudies by a naturall inclination beene more powerfull in mee then any others helpe (although ſome through an euill diſpoſition and ignorance haue ſo far traduced me as to ſay this was rather another mans worke then mine owne, but I leaue them to their folly) I had neuer done ſo much as I here publiſh; nor been fit or prepared for a larger, as time may ſuddenly (by Gods permiſsion) bring to light, if the maleuolent diſpoſitions of degenerate ſpirits doe not hinder the accompliſhment. <pb facs="tcp:15790:4"/> But perſwading my ſelfe there is no ſhowre that produceth not ſome fruit, or no word but worketh ſome effect, eyther of good to perſwade, or of reproofe to euince; I could not but declare my minde herein, let others iudge or ſay what they pleaſe. For I haue alwaies held it a thing vnfit, to conceale or bury that knowledge God hath giuen, and not to impart it, and further others therewith as much as is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, yet without ostentation, which I haue euer hated. Now further to informe the courteous Reader, both of the occaſion that led me on to this worke, and the other occurrences to it. Firſt, hauing peruſed many Herbals in Latine, I obſerued that moſt of them haue eyther neglected or not knowne the many diuerſities of the flower Plants, and rare fruits are known to vs at this time, and (except <hi>Cluſius</hi>) haue made mention but of a very few. In Engliſh likewiſe we haue ſome extant, as
<hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> tranſlated, who haue haue ſaid little of Flowers, <hi>Gerard</hi> who is laſt, hath no doubt giuen vs the knowledge of as many as he attained vnto in his time, but ſince his daies we haue had many more varieties, then he or they euer heard of, as may be perceiued by the ſtore I haue here produced. And none of them haue particularly ſeuered thoſe that are beautifull flower plants, fit to ſtore a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of delight and pleaſure, from the wilde and vnfit: but haue enterlaced many, one among another, whereby many that haue deſired to haue faire flowers, haue not known either what to chooſe, or what to deſire. Diuers Bookes of Flowers alſo haue been ſet forth, ſome in our owne Countrey, and more in others, all which are as it were but handfuls ſnatched from the plentifull Treaſury of Nature, none of them being willing or able to open all ſorts, and declare them fully; but the greateſt hinderance of all mens delight was, that none of them had giuen any deſcription of them, but the bare name only. To ſatisfie therefore their deſires that are louers of ſuch Delights, I took vpon me this labour and charge, and haue here ſelected and ſet forth a Garden of all the chiefeſt for choyce, and faireſt for ſhew, from among all the ſeuerall Tribes and Kindreds of Natures beauty, and haue ranked them as neere as I could, or as the worke would permit, in affinity one vnto another. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for their ſakes that are ſtudious in Authors, I haue ſet down the names haue bin formerly giuen vnto them, with ſome of their errours, not intending to cumber this worke with all that might bee ſaid of them, becauſe the deciding of the many controuerſies, doubts, and queſtions that concerne them, pertaine more fitly to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Hiſtory: yet I haue beene in ſome places more copious and ample then at the firſt I had intended, the occaſion drawing on my deſire to informe others with what I thought was fit to be known, reſeruing what elſe might be ſaid to another time &amp; worke; wherein (God willing) I will inlarge my ſelfe, the ſubiect matter requiring it at my hands, in what my ſmall ability can effect. Thirdly, I haue alſo to embelliſh this Worke ſet forth the figures of all ſuch plants and flowers as are materiall and different one from another: but not as ſome others haue done, that is, a number of the figures of one ſort of plant that haue nothing to diſtinguiſh them but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, for that I hold to be ſuperfluous and waſte. Fourthly, I haue alſo ſet down the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertues and Properties of them in a briefe manner, rather deſiring to giue you the knowledge of a few certaine and true, then to relate, as others haue done, a needleſs and falſe multiplicitie, that ſo there might as well profit as pleaſure be taken from them, and that nothing might be wanting to accompliſh it fully. And ſo much for this firſt part, my Garden of pleaſant and delightfull Flowers. My next Garden conſiſteth of Herbes and Rootes, fit to be eaten of the rich and poor as nouriſhment and food, as ſawce or condiment, as ſallet or refreſhing, for pleaſure or profit; where I doe as well play the Gardiner, to ſhew you (in briefe, but not at large) the times <pb facs="tcp:15790:5"/> and manner of ſowing, ſetting, planting, replanting, and the like (although all theſe things, and many more then are true, are ſet down very largely in the ſeuerall bookes that others haue written of this ſubiect) as alſo to ſhew ſome of the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen vſes (becauſe they are Kitchen herbes &amp;c.) although I confeſſe but very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, not intending a treatiſe of cookery, but briefly to giue a touch thereof; and alſo the Phyſicall properties, to ſhew ſomewhat that others haue not ſet forth; yet not to play the Empericke, and giue you receipts of medicines for all diſeaſes, but only to ſhew in ſome ſort the qualities of Herbes, to quicken the minds of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. And laſtly an Orchard of all ſorts of domeſticke or forraine, rare and good fruits, fit for this our Land and Countrey, which is at this time better ſtored and furniſhed then euer in any age before. I haue herein endeauoured, as in the other Gardens, to ſet forth the varieties of euery ſort in as briefe a manner as poſsibly could be, without ſuperfluous repetitions of deſcriptions, and onely with eſpeciall notes of difference in leaues, flowers and fruits. Some few properties alſo are ſet downe, rather the chiefeſt then the moſt, as the worke did require. And moreouer before euery of theſe parts I haue giuen Treatiſes of the ordering, preparing and keeping the ſeuerall Gardens and Orchard, with whatſoeuer I thought was conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to be known for euery of them.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I ſhewed you both the occaſion and ſcope of this Worke, and herein haue ſpent my time, paines and charge, which if well accepted, I ſhall thinke well employed, and may the ſooner haſten the fourth Part, A Garden of Simples; which will be quiet no longer at home, then that it can bring his Maſter newes of faire weather for the iourney.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſeuerall ſituations of mens dwellings, are for the moſt part vnauoideable and vnremoueable; for moſt men cannot appoint forth ſuch a manner of ſituation for their dwelling, as is moſt fit to auoide all the inconueniences of winde and weather, but muſt bee content with ſuch as the place will afford them; yet all men doe well know, that ſome ſituations are more excellent than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: according therfore to the ſeuerall ſituation of mens dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ſo are the ſituations of their gardens alſo for the moſt part. And although diuers doe diuerſly preferre their owne ſeuerall places which they haue choſen, or wherein they dwell. As ſome thoſe places that are neare vnto a riuer or brooke to be beſt for the pleaſantneſſe of the water, the caſe of tranſportation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, their friends and goods, as alſo for the fertility of the ſoyle, which is ſeldome bad neare vnto a riuers ſide; And others extoll the ſide or top of an hill, bee it ſmall or great, for the proſpects ſake; And againe, ſome the plaine or champian ground, for the euen leuell thereof: euery one of which, as they haue their commodities accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them, ſo haue they alſo their diſcommodities belonging vnto them, according to the Latine Prouerbe, <hi>Omne commodum fert ſuum incommodum.</hi> Yet to ſhew you for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of theſe ſituations which is the fitteſt place to plant your garden in, and how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from the iniuries of the cold windes and froſts that may annoy it, will, I hope, be well accepted. And firſt, for the water ſide, I ſuppoſe the North ſide of the water to be the beſt ſide for your garden, that it may haue the comfort of the South Sunne to lye vpon it and face it, and the dwelling houſe to bee aboue it, to defend the cold windes and froſts both from your herbes, and flowers, and early fruits. And ſo likewiſe I iudge for the hill ſide, that it may lye full open to the South Sunne, and the houſe aboue it, both for the comfort the ground ſhall receiue of the water and raine deſcending into it, and of defence from winter and colds. Now for the plaine leuell ground, the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the houſe ſhould be on the North ſide of the garden, that ſo they might bee a defence of much ſufficiency to ſafeguard it from many iniurious cold nights and dayes, which elſe might ſpoyle the pride thereof in the bud. But becauſe euery one cannot ſo appoint his dwelling, as I here appoint the fitteſt place for it to be, euery ones pleaſure thereof ſhall be according to the ſite, coſt, and endeauours they beſtow, to cauſe it come neareſt to this proportion, by ſuch helpes of bricke or ſtone wals to defend it, or by the helpe of high growne and well ſpread trees, planted on the North ſide thereof, to keepe it the warmer. And euery of theſe three ſituations, hauing the faireſt buildings of the houſe facing the garden in this manner before ſpecified, beſides the benefit of ſhelter it ſhall haue from them, the buildings and roomes abutting thereon, ſhall haue recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the beautifull proſpect into it, and haue both ſight and ſent of whatſoeuer is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and worthy to giue content out from it, which is one of the greateſt pleaſures a garden can yeeld his Maſter. Now hauing ſhewed you the beſt place where this your <pb n="2" facs="tcp:15790:8"/> garden ſhould be, let me likewiſe aduiſe you where it ſhould not be, at leaſt that it is the worſt place wherein it may be, if it be either on the Weſt or Eaſt ſide of your houſe, or that it ſtand in a mooriſh ground, or other vnwholſome ayre (for many, both fruits, herbes, and flowers that are tender, participate with the ayre, taking in a manner their chiefeſt thriuing from thence) or neare any common Lay-ſtalles, or common Sewers, or elſe neare any great Brew-houſe, Dye-houſe, or any other place where there is much ſmoake, whether it be of ſtraw, wood, or eſpecially of ſea-coales, which of all other is the worſt, as our Citie of London can giue proofe ſufficient, wherein neither herbe nor tree will long proſper, nor hath done euer ſince the vſe of ſea-coales beganne to bee fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent therein. And likewiſe that it is much the worſe, if it bee neare vnto any Barnes or Stackes of corne or hey, becauſe that from thence will continually with the winde bee brought into the garden the ſtrawe and chaffe of the corne, the duſt and ſeede of the hey to choake or peſter it. Next vnto the place or ſituation, let mee ſhew you the grounds or ſoyles for it, eyther naturall or artificiall. No man will deny, but the naturall blacke mould is not only the fatteſt and richeſt, but farre exceedeth any other either naturall or artificiall, as well in goodneſſe as durability. And next thereunto, I hold the ſandy loame (which is light and yet firme, but not looſe as ſand, nor ſtiffe like vnto clay) to be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferiour for this our Garden of pleaſure; for that it doth cauſe all bulbous and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berous rooted plants to thriue ſufficiently therein, as likewiſe all other flower-plants, Roſes, Trees, &amp;c. which if it ſhall decay by much turning and working out the heart of it, may ſoone be helped with old ſtable manure of horſes, being well turned in, when it is old and almoſt conuerted to mould. Other grounds, as chalke, ſand, grauell, or clay, are euery of them one more or leſſe fertill or barren than other; and therefore doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch helpes as is moſt fit for them. And thoſe grounds that are ouer dry, looſe, and duſtie, the manure of ſtall fedde beaſts and cattell being buried or trenched into the earth, and when it is thorough rotten (which will require twice the time that the ſtable ſoyle of horſes will) well turned and mixed with the earth, is the beſt ſoyle to temper both the heate and drineſſe of them. So contrariwiſe the ſtable dung of horſes is the beſt for cold grounds, to giue them heate and life. But of all other ſorts of grounds, the ſtiffe clay is the very worſt for this purpoſe, for that although you ſhould digge out the whole compaſſe of your Garden, carry it away, and bring other good mould in the ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and fill vp the place, yet the nature of that clay is ſo predominant, that in a ſmall time it will eate out the heart of the good mould, and conuert it to its owne nature, or very neare vnto it: ſo that to bring it to any good, there muſt bee continuall labour beſtowed thereon, by bringing into it good ſtore of chalke, lime, or ſand, or elſe aſhes eyther of wood or of ſea-coales (which is the beſt for this ground) well mixed and turned in with it. And as this ſtiffe clay is the worſt, ſo what ground ſoeuer commeth neareſt vnto the nature thereof, is neareſt vnto it in badneſſe, the ſignes whereof are the ouermuch moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture thereof in Winter, and the much cleauing and chapping thereof in Summer, when the heate of the yeare hath conſumed the moyſture, which tyed and bound it faſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as alſo the ſtiffe and hard working therein: but if the nature of the clay bee not too ſtiffe, but as it were tempered and mixed with ſand or other earths, your old ſtable ſoyle of horſes will helpe well the ſmall rifting or chapping thereof, to be plentifully beſtowed therin in a fit ſeaſon. Some alſo do commend the caſting of ponds and ditches, to helpe to manure theſe ſtiffe chapping grounds. Other grounds, that are ouermoiſt by ſprings, that lye too neare the vpper face of the earth, beſides that the beds thereof had need to be laid vp higher, and the allies, as trenches and furrowes, to lye lower, the ground it ſelfe had neede to haue ſome good ſtore of chalke-ſtones beſtowed thereon, ſome certaine yeares, if it may be, before it be laid into a Garden, that the Winter froſts may breake the chalke ſmall, and the Raine diſſolue it into mould, that ſo they may bee well mixed together; than which, there is not any better manure to ſoyle ſuch a moiſt ground, to helpe to dry vp the moyſture, and to giue heate and life to the coldneſſe thereof, which doth alwayes accompany theſe moiſt grounds, and alſo to cauſe it abide longer in heart than any other. For the ſandy and grauelly grounds, although I know the well mollified manure of beaſts and cattell to be excellent good, yet I know alſo, that ſome commend a white Marle, and ſome a clay to be well ſpread thereon, and after tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereinto: and for the chalkie ground, <hi>è conuerſo,</hi> I commend fatte clay to helpe it. You muſt vnderſtand, that the leſſe rich or more barren that your ground is, there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <pb n="3" facs="tcp:15790:8"/> the more care, labour, and coſt to bee beſtowed thereon, both to order it rightly, &amp; ſo to preſerue it from time to time: for no artificiall or forc't ground can endure good any long time, but that within a few yeares it muſt be refreſhed more or leſſe, according as it doth require. Yet you ſhall likewiſe vnderſtand, that this Garden of pleaſure ſtored with theſe Out-landiſh flowers; that is, bulbous and tuberous rooted plants, and other fine flowers, that I haue hereafter deſcribed, and aſſigned vnto it, needeth not ſo much or ſo often manuring with ſoyle, &amp;c. as another Garden planted with the other ſorts of Engliſh flowers, or a Garden of ordinary Kitchin herbes doth. Your ground likewiſe for this Garden had neede to bee well cleanſed from all annoyances (that may hinder the well doing or proſpering of the flowers therein) as ſtones, weedes, rootes of trees, buſhes, &amp;c. and all other things cumberſome or hurtfull; and therefore the earth being not naturally fine enough of it ſelfe, is vſed to bee ſifted to make it the finer, and that either through a hurdle made of ſticks, or lathes, or through ſquare or round ſieues plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with fine and ſtrong thin ſtickes, or with wyers in the bottome. Or elſe the whole earth of the Garden being courſe, may be caſt in the ſame manner that men vſe to try or fine ſand from grauell, that is, againſt a wall; whereby the courſer and more ſtony, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe from the fine, is to betaken away from the foote of the heape, the finer ſand and ground remaining ſtill aboue, and on the heape. Or elſe in the want of a wall to caſt it againſt, I haue ſeene earth fined by it ſelfe in this manner: Hauing made the floore or vpper part of a large plat of ground cleane from ſtones, &amp;c. let there a reaſonable round heape of fine earth be ſet in the midſt thereof, or inſtead thereof a large Garden flower-pot, or other great pot, the bottome turned vpwards, and then poure your courſe earth on the top or head thereof, one ſhouell full after another ſomewhat gently, and thereby all the courſe ſtuffe and ſtones will fall downe to the bottome round about the heape, which muſt continually be carefully taken away, and thus you may make your earth as fine as if it were caſt againſt a wall, the heape being growne great, ſeruing in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Thoſe that will not prepare their grounds in ſome of theſe manners aforeſaid, ſhall ſoone finde to their loſſe the neglect thereof: for the traſh and ſtones ſhall ſo hinder the encreaſe of their roots, that they will be halfe loſt in the earth among the ſtones, which elſe might be ſaued to ſerue to plant whereſoeuer they pleaſe.</p>

               <p>ALthough many men muſt be content with any plat of ground, of what forme or quantity ſoeuer it bee, more or leſſe, for their Garden, becauſe a more large or conuenient cannot bee had to their habitation: Yet I perſwade my ſelfe, that Gentlemen of the better ſort and quality, will prouide ſuch a parcell of ground to bee laid out for their Garden, and in ſuch conuenient manner, as may be fit and anſwerable to the degree they hold. To preſcribe one forme for euery man to follow, were too great preſumption and folly: for euery man will pleaſe his owne fancie, according to the extent he deſigneth out for that purpoſe, be it orbicular or round, triangular or three ſquare, quadrangular or foure ſquare, or more long than broad. I will onely ſhew you here the ſeuerall formes that many men haue taken and delighted in, let euery man chuſe which him liketh beſt, or may moſt fitly agree to that proportion of ground hee hath ſet out for that purpoſe. The orbicular or round forme is held in it owne proper exiſtence to be the moſt abſolute forme, containing within it all other formes whatſoeuer; but few I thinke will chuſe ſuch a proportion to be ioyned to their habitation, being not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any where I think, but for the generall Garden to the Vniuerſity at Padoa. The tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular or three ſquare is ſuch a forme alſo, as is ſeldome choſen by any that may make another choiſe, and as I thinke is onely had where another forme cannot be had, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie conſtraining them to be therewith content. The foure ſquare forme is the moſt vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accepted with all, and doth beſt agree to any mans dwelling, being (as I ſaid before) behinde the houſe, all the backe windowes thereof opening into it. Yet if it bee longer than the breadth, or broader than the length, the proportion of walkes, ſquares, and knots may be ſoon brought to the ſquare forme, and be ſo caſt, as the beauty thereof may <pb n="4" facs="tcp:15790:9"/>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:15790:9"/> bee no leſſe than the foure ſquare proportion, or any other better forme, if any be. To forme it therfore with walks, croſſe the middle both waies, and round about it alſo with hedges, with ſquares, knots and trayles, or any other worke within the foure ſquare parts, is according as euery mans conceit alloweth of it, and they will be at the charge: For there may be therein walkes eyther open or cloſe, eyther publike or priuate, a maze or wilderneſſe, a rocke or mount, with a fountaine in the midſt thereof to conuey water to euery part of the Garden, eyther in pipes vnder the ground, or brought by hand, and emptied into large Ciſternes or great Turkie Iarres, placed in conuenient places, to ſerue as an eaſe to water the neareſt parts thereunto. Arbours alſo being both gracefull and neceſſary, may be appointed in ſuch conuenient places, as the corners, or elſe where, as may be moſt fit, to ſerue both for ſhadow and reſt after walking. And becauſe many are deſirous to ſee the formes of trayles, knots, and other compartiments, and becauſe the open knots are more proper for theſe Out-landiſh flowers; I haue here cauſed ſome to be drawne, to ſatisfie their deſires, not intending to cumber this worke with ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, in that it would be almoſt endleſſe, to expreſſe ſo many as might bee conceiued and ſet downe, for that euery man may inuent others farre differing from theſe, or any other can be ſet forth. Let euery man therefore, if hee like of theſe, take what may pleaſe his mind, or out of theſe or his own conceit, frame any other to his fancy, or cauſe others to be done as he liketh beſt, obſeruing this
<hi>decorum,</hi> that according to his ground he do caſt out his knots, with conuenient roome for allies and walkes; for the fairer and larger your allies and walkes be, the more grace your Garden ſhall haue, the leſſe harme the herbes and flowers ſhall receiue, by paſſing by them that grow next vnto the allies ſides, and the better ſhall your Weeders cleanſe both the beds and the allies.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The many ſorts of herbes and other things, wherewith the beds and parts of knots are bordered to ſet out the forme of them, with their commodities and diſcommodities.</head>
               <p>IT is neceſſary alſo, that I ſhew you the ſeuerall materials, wherewith theſe knots and trayles are ſet forth and bordered; which are of two ſorts: The one are liuing herbes, and the other are dead materials; as leade, boords, bones, tyles, &amp;c. Of herbes, there are many ſorts wherewith the knots and beds in a Garden are vſed to bee ſet, to ſhew forth the forme of them, and to preſerue them the longer in their forme, as alſo to be as greene, and ſweete herbes, while they grow, to be cut to perfume the houſe, keeping them in ſuch order and proportion, as may be moſt conuenient for their ſeuerall natures, and euery mans pleaſure and fancy: Of all which, I intend to giue you the knowledge here in this place; and firſt, to begin with that which hath beene moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently receiued, which is Thrift. This is an euerliuing greene herbe, which many take to border their beds, and ſet their knots and trayles, and therein much delight, becauſe it will grow thicke and buſhie, and may be kept, being cut with a paire of Garden ſheeres, in ſome good handſome manner and proportion for a time, and beſides, in the Summer time ſend forth many ſhort ſtalkes of pleaſant flowers, to decke vp an houſe among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſweete herbes: Yet theſe inconueniences doe accompany it; it will not onely in a ſmall time ouergrow the knot or trayle in many places, by growing ſo thicke and buſhie, that it will put out the forme of a knot in many places: but alſo much thereof will dye with the froſts and ſnowes in Winter, and with the drought in Summer, whereby many voide places will be ſeene in the knot, which doth much deforme it, and muſt therefore bee yearely refreſhed: the thickneſſe alſo and buſhing thereof doth hide and ſhelter ſnayles and other ſmall noyſome wormes ſo plentifully, that Gilloflowers, and other fine herbes and flowers being planted therein, are much ſpoyled by them, and cannot be helped without much induſtry, and very great and daily attendance to deſtroy them. Germander is another herbe, in former times alſo much vſed, and yet alſo in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and becauſe it will grow thicke, and may be kept alſo in ſome forme and proportion with cutting, and that the cuttings are much vſed as a ſtrawing herbe for houſes, being pretty and ſweete, is alſo much affected by diuers: but this alſo will often dye and grow out of forme, and beſides that, the ſtalkes will grow too great, hard and ſtubby, the rootes doe ſo farre ſhoote vnder ground, that vpon a little continuance thereof, will <pb n="6" facs="tcp:15790:10"/> ſpread into many places within the knot, which it continually they be not plucked vp, they will ſpoile the whole knot it ſelfe; and therefore once in three or foure yeares at the moſt, it muſt be taken vp and new ſet, or elſe it will grow too royniſh and cumberſome. Hyſſope hath alſo been vſed to be ſet about a knot, and being ſweet, will ſerue for ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as Germander: But this, although the rootes doe not runne or creep like it, yet the ſtalkes doe quickly grow great aboue ground, and dye often after the firſt yeares ſetting, whereby the grace of the knot will be much loſt. Marierome, Sauorie, and Thyme, in the like manner being ſweete herbes, are vſed to border vp beds and knots, and will be kept for a little while, with cutting, into ſome conformity; but all and euery of them ſerue moſt commonly but for one yeares vſe, and will ſoone decay and periſh: and therefore none of theſe, no more than any of the former, doe I commend for a good bordering herbe for this purpoſe. Lauander Cotton alſo being finely ſlipped and ſet, is of many, and thoſe of the higheſt reſpect of late daies, accepted, both for the beauty and forme of the herbe, being of a whitiſh greene mealy colour, for his ſent ſmelling ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrong, and being euerliuing and abiding greene all the Winter, will, by cutting, be kept in as euen proportion as any other herbe may be. This will likewiſe ſoone grow great and ſtubbed, notwithſtanding the cutting, and beſides will now and then periſh in ſome places, eſpecially if you doe not ſtrike or put off the ſnow, before the Sunne lying vpon it diſſolue it: The rarity &amp; nouelty of this herbe, being for the moſt part but in the Gardens of great perſons, doth cauſe it to be of the greater regard, it muſt therfore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed wholly euery ſecond or third yeare at the moſt, becauſe of the great growing therof. Slips of Iuniper or Yew are alſo receiued of ſome &amp; planted, becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes green, and that the Iuniper eſpecially hath not that ill ſent that Boxe hath, which I will preſently commend vnto you, yet both Iuniper and Yew will ſoon grow too great and ſtubbed, and force you to take vp your knot ſooner, than if it were planted with Boxe. Which laſtly, I chiefly and aboue all other herbes commend vnto you, and being a ſmall, lowe, or dwarfe kinde, is called French or Dutch Boxe, and ſerueth very well to ſet out any knot, or border out any beds: for beſides that it is euer greene, it being reaſonable thicke ſet, will eaſily be cut and formed into any faſhion one will, according to the nature thereof, which is to grow very ſlowly, and will not in a long time riſe to be of any height, but ſhooting forth many ſmall branches from the roote, will grow very thicke, and yet not require ſo great tending, nor ſo much periſh as any of the former, and is onely receiued into the Gardens of thoſe that are curious. This (as I before ſaid) I commend and hold to bee the beſt and ſureſt herbe to abide faire and greene in all the bitter ſtormes of the ſharpeſt Winter, and all the great heates and droughts of Summer, and doth recompence the want of a good ſweet ſent with his freſh verdure, euen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and long laſting continuance. Yet theſe inconueniences it hath, that beſides the vnpleaſing ſent which many miſlike, and yet is but ſmall, the rootes of this Boxe do ſo much ſpread themſelues into the ground of the knot, and doe draw from thence ſo much nouriſhment, that it robbeth all the herbes that grow neare it of their ſap and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, thereby making all the earth about it barren, or at leaſt leſſe fertile. Wherefore to ſhew you the remedy of this inconuenience of ſpreading, without either taking vp the Boxe of the border, or the herbes and flowers in the knot, is I thinke a ſecret knowne but vnto a few, which is this: You ſhall take a broad pointed Iron like vnto a Sliſe or Cheſſill, which thruſt downe right into the ground a good depth all along the inſide of the border of Boxe ſomewhat cloſe thereunto, you may thereby cut away the ſpreading rootes thereof, which draw ſo much moiſture from the other herbes on the inſide, and by this meanes both preſerue your herbes and flowers in the knot, and your Boxe alſo, for that the Boxe will be nouriſhed ſufficiently from the reſt of the rootes it ſhooteth on all the other ſides. And thus much for the liuing herbes, that ſerue to ſet or border vp any knot. Now for the dead materials, they are alſo, as I ſaid before diuers: as firſt, Leade, which ſome that are curious doe border their knots withall, cauſing it to be cut of the breadth of foure fingers, bowing the lower edge a little outward, that it may lye vnder the vpper cruſt of the ground, and that it may ſtand the faſter, and making the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per edge either plain, or cut out like vnto the battlements of a Church: this faſhion hath delighted ſome, who haue accounted it ſtately (at the leaſt coſtly) and fit for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and the rather, becauſe it will be bowed and bended into any round ſquare, angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or other proportion as one liſteth, and is not much to be miſliked, in that the Leade <pb n="7" facs="tcp:15790:10"/> doth not eaſily breake or ſpoile without much iniury, and keepeth vp a knot for a very long time in his due proportion: but in my opinion, the Leade is ouer-hot for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ouer-cold for Winter. Others doe take Oaken inch boords, and ſawing them foure or fiue inches broad, do hold vp their knot therewith: but in that theſe boordes cannot bee drawne compaſſe into any ſmall ſcantling, they muſt ſerue rather for long outright beds, or ſuch knots as haue no rounds, halfe rounds, or compaſſings in them. And beſides, theſe boordes are not long laſting, becauſe they ſtand continually in the weather, eſpecially the ends where they are faſtned together will ſooneſt rot and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and ſo the whole forme will be ſpoyled. To preuent that fault, ſome others haue choſen the ſhanke bones of Sheep, which after they haue beene well cleanſed and boyled, to take out the fat from them, are ſtucke into the ground the ſmall end downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the knockle head vpwards, and thus being ſet ſide to ſide, or end to end cloſe together, they ſet out the whole knot therewith, which heads of bones although they looke not white the firſt yeare, yet after they haue abiden ſome froſts and heates will become white, and prettily grace out the ground: but this inconuenience is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them, that the Winter froſts will raiſe them out of the ground oftentimes, and if by chance the knockle head of any doe breake, or be ſtrucke off with any ones foot, &amp;c. going by, from your ſtore, that lyeth by you of the ſame ſort, ſet another in the place, hauing firſt taken away the broken peece: although theſe will laſt long in forme and order, yet becauſe they are but bones many miſlike them, and indeed I know but few that vſe them. Tyles are alſo vſed by ſome, which by reaſon they may bee brought compaſſe into any faſhion many are pleaſed with them, who doe not take the whole Tyle at length, but halfe Tyles, and other broken peeces ſet ſomewhat deepe into the ground, that they may ſtand faſt, and theſe take vp but little roome, and keepe vp the edge of the beds and knots in a pretty comely manner, but they are often out of frame, in that many of them are broken and ſpoiled, both with mens feete paſſing by, the weather and weight of the earth beating them downe and breaking them, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the froſts in Winter doe ſo cracke off their edges, both at the toppes and ſides that ſtand cloſe one vnto another, that they muſt bee continually tended and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, with freſh and ſound ones put in the place of them that are broken or decayed. And laſtly (for it is the lateſt inuention) round whitiſh or blewiſh pebble ſtones, of ſome reaſonable proportion and bigneſſe, neither too great nor too little, haue beene vſed by ſome to be ſet, or rather in a manner but laide vpon the ground to faſhion out the traile or knot, or all along by the large grauelly walke ſides to ſet out the walke, and maketh a pretty handſome ſhew, and becauſe the ſtones will not decay with the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of any time or weather, and will be placed in their places againe, if any ſhould be thruſt out by any accident, as alſo that their ſight is ſo conſpicuous vpon the ground, eſpecially if they be not hid with the ſtore of herbes growing in the knot; is accounted both for durability, beauty of the ſight, handſomneſſe in the worke, and eaſe in the working and charge, to be of all other dead materials the chiefeſt. And thus, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I haue ſhewed you all the varieties that I know are vſed by any in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that are worth the reciting (but as for the faſhion of Iawe-bones, vſed by ſome in the Low-Countries, and other places beyond the Seas, being too groſſe and baſe, I make no mention of them) among which euery one may take what pleaſeth him beſt, or may moſt fitly be had, or may beſt agree with the ground or knot. Moreouer, all theſe herbes that ſerue for borderings, doe ſerue as well to be ſet vpon the ground of a leuelled knot; that is, where the allies and foot-pathes are of the ſame leuell with the knot, as they may ſerue alſo for the raiſed knot, that is, where the beds of the knot are raiſed higher than the allies: but both Leade, Boordes, Bones, and Tyles, are only for the raiſed ground, be it knot or beds. The pebble ſtones againe are onely for the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled ground, becauſe they are ſo ſhallow, that as I ſaid before, they rather lye vpon the earth than are thruſt any way into it. All this that I haue here ſet downe, you muſt vnderſtand is proper for the knots alone of a Garden. But for to border the whole ſquare or knot about, to ſerue as a hedge thereunto, euery one taketh what liketh him beſt; as either Priuet alone, or ſweete Bryer, and white Thorne enterlaced together, and Roſes of one, or two, or more ſorts placed here and there amongſt them. Some alſo take Lauander, Roſemary, Sage, Southernwood, Lauander Cotton, or ſome ſuch other thing. Some againe plant Cornell Trees, and plaſh them, or keepe them lowe, to <pb n="8" facs="tcp:15790:11"/> forme them into an hedge. And ſome againe take a lowe prickly ſhrubbe, that abideth alwayes greene, deſcribed in the end of this Booke, called in Latine
<hi>Pyracantha,</hi> which in time will make an euer greene hedge or border, and when it beareth fruit, which are red berries like vnto Hawthorne berries, make a glorious ſhew among the greene leaues in the Winter time, when no other ſhrubbes haue fruit or leaues.</p>

And becauſe there bee many Gentlewomen and others, that would gladly haue ſome fine flowers to furniſh their Gardens, but know not what the names of thoſe things are that they deſire, nor what are the times of their flowring, nor the skill and knowledge of their right ordering, planting, diſplanting, tranſplanting, and replanting; I haue here for their ſakes ſet downe the nature, names, times, and manner of ordering in a briefe manner, referring the more ample declaration of them to the worke following. And firſt of their names and natures: Of Daffodils there are almoſt an hundred ſorts, as they are ſeuerally deſcribed hereafter, euery one to be diſtinguiſhed from other, both in their times, formes, and colours, ſome being eyther white, or yellow, or mixt, or elſe being ſmall or great, ſingle or double, and ſome hauing but one flower vpon a ſtalke, others many, whereof many are ſo exceeding ſweete, that a very few are ſufficient to perfume a whole chamber, and beſides, many of them be ſo faire and double, eyther one vpon a ſtalke, or many vpon a ſtalke, that one or two ſtalkes of flowers are in ſtead of a whole noſe-gay, or bundell of flowers tyed together. This I doe affirme vpon good knowledge and certaine experience, and not as a great many others doe, tell of the wonders of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, which themſelues neuer ſaw nor euer heard of, except ſome ſuperficiall relation, which themſelues haue augmented according to their owne fanſie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Againe, let me here alſo by the way tell you, that many idle and ignorant Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and others, who get names by ſtealth, as they doe many other things, doe call <pb n="9" facs="tcp:15790:11"/> ſome of theſe Daffodils Narciſſes, when as all know that know any Latine, that Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus is the Latine name, and Daffodill the Engliſh of one and the ſame thing; and therefore alone without any other Epithite cannot properly diſtinguiſh ſeuerall things. I would willingly therefore that all would grow iudicious, and call euery thing by his proper Engliſh name in ſpeaking Engliſh, or elſe by ſuch Latine name as euery thing hath that hath not a proper Engliſh name, that thereby they may diſtinguiſh the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall varieties of things and not confound them, as alſo to take away all excuſes of miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; as for example: The ſingle Engliſh baſtard Daffodill (which groweth wilde in many Woods, Groues, and Orchards in England.) The double Engliſh baſtard Daffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dill. The French ſingle white Daffodill many vpon a ſtalke. The French double yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Daffodill. The great, or the little, or the leaſt Spaniſh yellow baſtard Daffodill, or the great or little Spaniſh white Daffodill. The Turkie ſingle white Daffodill, or, The Turkie ſingle or double white Daffodill many vpon a ſtalke, &amp;c. Of Fritillaria, or the checkerd Daffodill, there are halfe a ſcore ſeuerall ſorts, both white and red, both yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and blacke, which are a wonderfull grace and ornament to a Garden in regard of the Checker like ſpots are in the flowers. Of Iacinthes there are aboue halfe an hundred ſorts, as they are ſpecified hereafter; ſome like vnto little bells or ſtarres, others like vnto little bottles or pearles, both white and blew, sky-coloured and bluſh, and ſome ſtarlike of many pretty various formes, and all to giue delight to them that will be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to obſerue them. Of Crocus or Saffron flowers, there are alſo twenty ſorts; ſome of the Spring time, others flowring onely in the Autume or Fall, earlier or later than another, ſome whereof abide but a while, others indure aboue a moneth in their glorious beauty. The Colchicum or Medowe Saffron, which ſome call the ſonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the father, but not properly, is of many ſorts alſo; ſome flowring in the Spring of the yeare, but the moſt in Autume, whereof ſome haue faire double flowers very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to behold, and ſome party coloured both ſingle and double ſo variable, that it would make any one admire the worke of the Creatour in the various ſpots and ſtripes of theſe flowers. Then haue wee of Lillies twenty ſeuerall ſorts and colours, among whom I muſt reckon the Crowne Imperiall, that for his ſtately forme deſerueth ſome ſpeciall place in this Garden, as alſo the Martagons, both white and red, both bluſh and yellow, that require to be ſet by themſelues apart, as it were in a ſmall round or ſquare of a knot, without many other, or tall flowers growing neare them. But to tell you of all the ſorts of Tulipas (which are the pride of delight) they are ſo many, and as I may ſay, almoſt infinite, doth both paſſe my ability, and as I beleeue the skill of any other. They are of two eſpeciall ſorts, ſome flowring earlier, and others later than their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and that naturally in all grounds, wherein there is ſuch a wonderfull variety and mixture of colours, that it is almoſt impoſſible for the wit of man to deſcipher them thoroughly, and to giue names that may be true &amp; ſeuerall diſtinctions to euery flower, threeſcore ſeuerall ſorts of colours ſimple and mixed of each kind I can reckon vp that I haue, and of eſpeciall note, and yet I doubt not, but for euery one of them there are ten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers differing from them, which may be ſeen at ſeuerall times, and in ſeuerall places: &amp; beſides this glory of variety in colors that theſe flowers haue, they carry ſo ſtately &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull a forme, &amp; do abide ſo long in their brauery (enduring aboue three whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths from the firſt vnto the laſt) that there is no Lady or Gentlewoman of any worth that is not caught with this delight, or not delighted with theſe flowers. The Anemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes likewiſe or Windeflowers are ſo full of variety and ſo dainty, ſo pleaſant and ſo delightſome flowers, that the ſight of them doth enforce an earneſt longing deſire in the minde of any one to be a poſſeſſour of ſome of them at the leaſt: For without all doubt, this one kinde of flower, ſo variable in colours, ſo differing in forme (being almoſt as many ſorts of them double as ſingle) ſo plentifull in bearing flowers, and ſo durable in laſting, and alſo ſo eaſie both to preſerue and to encreaſe, is of it ſelfe alone almoſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to furniſh a garden with their flowers for almoſt halfe the yeare, as I ſhall ſhew you in a fit and conuenient place. The Beares eares or French Cowſlips muſt not want their deſerued commendations, ſeeing that their flowers, being many ſet together vpon a ſtalke, doe ſeeme euery one of them to bee a Noſegay alone of it ſelfe: and beſides the many differing colours that are to be ſeene in them, as white, yellow, bluſh, purple, red, tawney, murrey, haire colour, &amp;c. which encreaſe much delight in all ſorts of the Gentry of the Land, they are not vnfurniſhed with a pretty ſweete ſent, <pb n="10" facs="tcp:15790:12"/> which doth adde an encreaſe of pleaſure in thoſe that make them an ornament for their wearing. Flowerdeluces alſo are of many ſorts, but diuided into two eſpeciall kindes; the one bearing a leafe like a flagge, whoſe rootes are tuberous, thicke and ſhort (one kinde of them being the Orris rootes that are ſold at the Apothecaries, whereof ſweete powders are made to lye among garments) the other hauing round rootes like vnto Onions, and narrow long leaues ſomewhat like graſſe: Of both theſe kindes there is much variety, eſpecially in their colours. The greater Flagge kinde is frequent enough and diſperſed in this Land, and well doth ſerue to decke vp both a Garden and Houſe with natures beauties: But the chiefe of all is your Sable flower, ſo fit for a mourning habit, that I thinke in the whole compaſſe of natures ſtore, there is not a more patheticall, or of greater correſpondency, nor yet among all the flowers I know any one comming neare vnto the colour of it. The other kinde which hath bulbous or Onion like rootes, diuerſifieth it ſelfe alſo into ſo many fine colours, being of a more neate ſhape and ſuccinct forme than the former, that it muſt not bee wanting to furniſh this Garden. The Hepatica or Noble Liuerwoort is another flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of account, whereof ſome are white, others red, or blew, or purple, ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling Violets, but that there are white threads in the middeſt of their flowers, which adde the more grace vnto them; and one kinde of them is ſo double, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth a double thicke Daſie or Marigold, but being ſmall and of an excellent blew colour, is like vnto a Button: but that which commendeth the flower as much as the beauty, is the earlineſſe in flowring, for that it is one of the very firſt flowers that open themſelues after Chriſtmas, euen in the midſt of Winter. The Cyclamen or Sowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread is a flower of rare receipt, becauſe it is naturally hard to encreaſe, and that the flowers are like vnto red or bluſh coloured Violets, flowring in the end of Summer or beginning of Autumne: the leaues likewiſe hereof haue no ſmall delight in their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant colour, being ſpotted and circled white vpon greene, and that which moſt prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, is the Phyſicall properties thereof for women, which I will declare when I ſhall ſhew you the ſeuerall deſcriptions of the varieties in his proper place. Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorts of flowers there are fit to furniſh this Garden, as Leucoium or Bulbous Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, both early and late flowring. Muſcari or Muske Grape flower. Starre flowers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſorts. Phalangium or Spiderwort, the chiefe of many is that ſort whoſe flowers are like vnto a white Lilly. Winter Crowfoote or Wolfes bane. The Chriſtmas flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er like vnto a ſingle white Roſe. Bell flowers of many kindes. Yellow Larkes ſpurre, the prettieſt flower of a ſcore in a Garden. Flower-gentle or Floramour. Flower of the Sunne. The Maruaile of Peru or of the world. Double Marſh Marigold or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yellow Buttons, much differing and farre exceeding your double yellow Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote, which ſome call Batchelours Buttons. Double French Marigolds that ſmell well, and is a greater kinde than the ordinary, and farre ſurpaſſeth it. The double red Ranunculus or Crowfoote (farre excelling the moſt glorious double Anemone) and is like vnto our great yellow double Crowfoote. Thus hauing giuen you the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome of the choiſeſt flowers for the beds of this Garden, let me alſo ſhew you what are fitteſt for your borders, and for your arbours. The Iaſmine white and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The double Honyſockle. The Ladies Bower, both white, and red, and purple ſingle and double, are the fitteſt of Outlandiſh plants to ſet by arbours and banqueting houſes, that are open, both before and aboue to helpe to couer them, and to giue both ſight, ſmell, and delight. The ſorts of Roſes are fitteſt for ſtandards in the hedges or borders. The Cherry Bay or Lauroceraſus. The Roſe Bay or Oleander. The white and the blew Syringa or Pipe tree, are all gracefull and delightfull to ſet at ſeuerall diſtances in the borders of knots; for ſome of them giue beautifull and ſweete flowers. The Pyracantha or Prickly Corall tree doth remaine with greene leaues all the yeare, and may be plaſhed, or laid downe, or tyed to make a fine hedge to border the whole knot, as is ſaid before. The Wilde Bay or Laurus Tinus, doth chiefly deſire to be ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered vnder a wall, where it will beſt thriue, and giue you his beautifull flowers in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for your delight, in recompence of his fenced dwelling. The Dwarfe Bay or Meſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reon, is moſt commonly either placed in the midſt of a knot, or at the corners thereof, and ſometimes all along a walke for the more grace. And thus to fit euery ones fancy, I haue ſhewed you the variety of natures ſtore in ſome part for you to diſpoſe of them to your beſt content.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The nature and names of thoſe that are called vſually Engliſh flowers.</head>
               <p>THoſe flowers that haue beene vſually planted in former times in Gardens of this Kingdome (when as our forefathers knew few or none of thoſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited before) haue by time and cuſtome attained the name of Engliſh flowers, although the moſt of them were neuer naturall of this our Land, but brought in from other Countries at one time or other, by thoſe that tooke pleaſure in them where they firſt ſaw them: and I doubt not, but many other ſorts than here are ſet downe, or now knowne to vs, haue beene brought, which either haue periſhed by their negligence or want of skill that brought them, or elſe becauſe they could not abide our cold Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; thoſe onely remaining with vs that haue endured of themſelues, and by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing haue beene diſtributed ouer the whole Land. If I ſhould make any large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of them, being ſo well knowne to all, I doubt I ſhould make a long tale to ſmall purpoſe: I will therefore but briefly recite them, that you may haue them together in one place, with ſome little declaration of the nature and quality of them, and ſo paſſe to other matters. And firſt of Primroſes and Cowſlips, whereof there are many pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie varieties; ſome better knowne in the Weſt parts of this Kingdome, others in the North, than in any other, vntill of late being obſerued by ſome curious louers of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, they haue been tranſplanted diuerſly, and ſo made more common: for although we haue had formerly in theſe parts about London greene Primroſes vſually, yet we neuer ſaw or heard of greene Cowſlips both ſingle and double but of late dayes, and ſo likewiſe for Primroſes to be both ſingle and double from one roote, and diuers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ſtalke of diuers faſhions, I am ſure is not vſuall: all which deſire rather to bee planted vnder ſome hedge, or fence, or in the ſhade, than in the Sunne. Single Roſe Campions, both white, red, and bluſh, and the double red Roſe Campion alſo is knowne ſufficiently, and will abide moderate Sunne as well as the ſhade. The flower of Briſtow or None-ſuch is likewiſe another kinde of Campion, whereof there is both white flowring plants and bluſh as well as Orange colour, all of them being ſingle flowers require a moderate Sunne and not the ſhadow: But the Orange colour None-ſuch with double flowers, as it is rare and not common, ſo for his brauery doth well deſerue a Maſter of account that will take care to keepe and preſerue it. Batchelours Buttons both white and red, are kindes of wilde Campions of a very double forme, and will reaſonably well like the Sunne but not the ſhade. Wall-flowers are common in euery Garden, as well the ordinary double as the ſingle, and the double kinde deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no more ſhade than the ſingle, but the greater kindes both double and ſingle muſt haue the Sunne. Stock-Gilloflowers likewiſe are almoſt as common as Wall-flowers, eſpecially the ſingle kindes in euery womans Garden, but the double kindes are much more rare, and poſſeſſed but of a few, and thoſe onely that will bee carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them in Winter; for beſides that the moſt of them are more tender, they yeeld no ſeede as the ſingle kindes doe to preſerue them, although one kinde from the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſeed yeeld double flowers: They will all require the comfort of the Sunne, eſpecially the double kindes, and to be defended from cold, yet ſo as in the Summer they doe not want water wherein they much ioy, and which is as it were their life. Queenes Gilloflowers (which ſome call Dames Violets, and ſome Winter Gilloflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are a kinde of Stock-Gilloflower) planted in Gardens to ſerue to fill vp the parts thereof for want of better things, hauing in mine opinion neither ſight nor ſent much to commend them. Violets are the Springs chiefe flowers for beauty, ſmell, and vſe, both ſingle and double, the more ſhadie and moiſt they ſtand the better. Snapdragon are flowers of much more delight, and in that they are more tender to keep, and will hardly endure the ſharpe Winters, vnleſſe they ſtand well defended, are ſcarce ſeene in many Gardens. Columbines ſingle and double, of many ſorts, faſhions, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, very variable both ſpeckled and party coloured, are flowers of that reſpect, as that no Garden would willingly bee without them, that could tell how to haue them, yet the rarer the flowers are, the more trouble to keepe; the ordinary ſorts on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <pb n="12" facs="tcp:15790:13"/> part will not be loſt, doe what one will. Larkes heeles, or ſpurres, or toes, as in ſeuerall Countries they are called, exceed in the varietie of colours, both ſingle and double, any of the former times; for vntill of late dayes none of the moſt pleaſant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours were ſeene or heard of: but now the ſingle kindes are reaſonable well diſperſt ouer the Land, yet the double kindes of all thoſe pleaſant colours (and ſome other alſo as beautifull) which ſtand like little double Roſes, are enioyed but of a few: all of them riſe from ſeed, and muſt be ſowne euery yeare, the double as well as the ſingle. Panſyes or Hartes eaſes of diuers colours, and although without ſent, yet not without ſome reſpect and delight. Double Poppies are flowers of a great and goodly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adorning a Garden with their variable colours to the delight of the beholders, wherein there is ſome ſpeciall care to be taken, leſt they turne ſingle; and that is, if you ſee them grow vp too thicke, that you muſt pull them vp, and not ſuffer them to grow within leſſe than halfe a yard diſtance, or more one from another. Double Daiſies are flowers not to be forgotten, although they be common enough in euery Garden, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both white and red, both bluſh and ſpeckled, or party coloured, beſides that which is called Iacke an Apes on horſebacke, they require a moiſt and ſhadowie place; for they are ſcorched away, if they ſtand in the Sunne in any dry place. Double Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigolds alſo are the moſt common in all Gardens. And ſo are the French Marigolds that haue a ſtrong heady ſent, both ſingle and double, whoſe glorious ſhew for colour would cauſe any to beleeue there were ſome rare goodneſſe or vertue in them. Theſe all are ſometimes preſerued in the Winter, if they bee well defended from the cold. But what ſhall I ſay to the Queene of delight and of flowers, Carnations and Gillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, whoſe brauery, variety, and ſweete ſmell ioyned together, tyeth euery ones affection with great earneſtneſſe, both to like and to haue them? Thoſe that were knowne, and enioyed in former times with much acceptation, are now for the moſt part leſſe accounted of, except a very few: for now there are ſo many other varieties of later inuention, that troubleth the other both in number, beauty, and worth: The names of them doe differ very variably, in that names are impoſed and altered as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ones fancy will haue them, that carryed or ſent them into the ſeuerall Countries from London, where their trueſt name is to be had, in mine opinion. I will here but giue you the names of ſome, and referre you to the worke enſuing for your further knowledge. The red and the gray Hulo. The old Carnation, differing from them both. The Gran Pere. The Camberſiue. The Sauadge. The Chriſtall. The Prince. The white Carnation, or Delicate. The ground Carnation. The French Carnation. The Douer. The Oxford. The Briſtow. The Weſtminſter. The Daintie. The Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado, and many other Gilloflowers too tedious to recite in this place, becauſe I haue amply declared them in the booke following. But there is another ſort of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and varietie, called the Orange tawny Gilloflower, which for the moſt part hath riſen from ſeed, and doth giue ſeed in a more plentifull manner than any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſorts, and likewiſe by the ſowing of the ſeed there hath been gained ſo many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of that excellent worth and reſpect, that it can hardly be expreſſed or beleeued, and called by diuers names according to the marking of the flowers; as The Infanta. The Stript Tawny. The Speckled Tawny. The Flackt Tawny. The Griſeld Tawny, and many others, euery one to bee diſtinguiſhed from others: Some alſo haue their flowers more double and large than others, and ſome from the ſame ſeed haue ſingle flowers like broad ſingle Pinkes: the further relation of them, <hi>viz.</hi> their order to ſowe, encreaſe, and preſerue them, you ſhall haue in the ſubſequent diſcourſe in a place by it ſelfe. Pinkes likewiſe both ſingle and double are of much variety, all of them very ſweete, comming neare the Gilloflowers. Sweete Williams and Sweete Iohns, both ſingle and double, both white, red, and ſpotted, as they are kindes of wilde Pinkes, ſo for their grace and beauty helpe to furniſh a Garden, yet deſire not to ſtand ſo open to the Sunne as the former. Double and ſingle Peonies are fit flowers to furniſh a Garden, and by reaſon of their durability, giue out freſh pleaſure euery yeare without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble of ſowing. And laſtly, Hollihocks both ſingle and double, of many and ſundry colours, yeeld out their flowers like Roſes on their tall branches, like Trees, to ſute you with flowers, when almoſt you haue no other to grace out your Garden: the ſingle and double doe both yeeld ſeed, and yet doe after their ſeeding abide many yeares. Thus haue I ſhewed you moſt of the Engliſh, as well as (I did before) the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh <pb n="13" facs="tcp:15790:13"/> flowers, that are fit to furniſh the knots, trailes, beds, and borders of this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Roſes onely, as I ſaid before, I reſerue to circle or encompaſſe all the reſt, becauſe that for the moſt part they are planted in the outer borders of the quarters, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by themſelues in the middle of long beds, the ſorts or kindes whereof are many, as they are declared in their proper place: but the White Roſe, the Red, and the Damaske, are the moſt ancient Standards in England, and therefore accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted naturall.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The order and manner to plant and replant all the ſorts of Out-landiſh flowers ſpoken of before, as well thoſe with bulbous rootes, as others with ſtringie rootes.</head>
               <p>WHereas it is the vſuall cuſtome of moſt in this Land, to turne vp their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and to plant them againe in the Spring of the yeare, which is the beſt time that may bee choſen for all Engliſh flowers, yet it is not ſo for your Out-landiſh flowers. And herein indeede hath beene not onely the errour of a great many to hinder their rootes from bearing out their flowers as they ſhould, but alſo to hinder many to take delight in them, becauſe as they ſay they will not thriue and proſper with them, when as the whole fault is in the want of knowledge of the fit and conuenient time wherein they ſhould bee planted. And becauſe our Engliſh Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners are all or the moſt of them vtterly ignorant in the ordering of theſe Out-landiſh flowers, as not being trained vp to know them, I haue here taken vpon mee the forme of a new Gardiner, to giue inſtructions to thoſe that will take pleaſure in them, that they may be the better enabled with theſe helpes I ſhall ſhew them, both to know how they ſhould be ordered, and to direct their Gardiners <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat are ignorant thereof, rightly to diſpoſe them according to their naturall qualities. And I doe wiſhall Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, whom it may concerne for their owne good, to bee as carefull whom they truſt with the planting and replanting of theſe fine flowers, as they would be with ſo many Iewels; for the rootes of many of them being ſmall, and of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, may be ſoone conueyed away, and a cleanly tale faire told, that ſuch a roote is rotten, or periſhed in the ground if none be ſeene where it ſhould be, or elſe that the flower hath changed his colour, when it hath been taken away, or a counterfeit one hath beene put in the place thereof; and thus many haue been deceiued of their dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt flowers, without remedy or true knowledge of the defect. You ſhall therefore, if you will take the right courſe that is proper for theſe kindes of flowers, not ſet or plant them among your Engliſh flowers; for that when the one may be remoued, the other may not be ſtirred: but plant thoſe rootes that are bulbous, or round like Onions, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in knots or beds by themſelues which is the beſt, or with but very few Engliſh or Out-landiſh flower plants that haue ſtringie rootes: For you muſt take this for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule, that all thoſe rootes that are like Lillies or Onions, are to bee planted in the moneths of Iuly or Auguſt, or vnto the middle or end of September at the furtheſt, if you will haue them to proſper as they ſhould; and not in the Spring of the yeare, when other gardening is vſed. Yet I muſt likewiſe giue you to vnderſtand, that if Tulipas, and Daffodils, and ſome other that are firme and hard rootes, and not limber or ſpongie, being taken vp out of the ground in their fit ſeaſon, that is, in Iune, Iuly, and Auguſt, and likewiſe kept well and dry, may bee reſerued out of the ground vntill Chriſtmas or after, and then (if they could not be ſet ſooner) being ſet, will thriue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable well, but not altogether ſo well as the former, being ſet long before: but if you ſhall remoue theſe bulbous rootes againe, either preſently after their planting ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhot their ſmall fibres vnder the round rootes, and ſprung likewiſe vpwards, or before they be in flower at the ſooneſt (yet Tulipas, Daffodils, and many other bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous, may be ſafely remoued being in flower, and tranſplanted into other places, ſo as they be not kept too long out of the ground) you ſhall much endanger them either vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to periſh, or to be hindered from bearing out their flowers they then would haue
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15790:14"/> borne, and for two or three years after from bearing flowers againe. For the order of their planting there are diuers wayes, ſome whereof I will ſhew you in this place: Your knot or beds being prepared fitly, as before is declared, you may place and order your rootes therein thus, Eyther many rootes of one kind ſet together in a round or cluſter, or longwiſe croſſe a bed one by another, whereby the beauty of many flowers of one kinde being together, may make a faire ſhew well pleaſing to many; Or elſe you may plant one or two in a place diſperſedly ouer the whole knot, or in a proportion or dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter one place anſwering another of the knot, as your ſtore will ſuffer you, or your knot permit: Or you may alſo mingle theſe rootes in their planting many of diuers ſorts together, that they may giue the more glorious ſhew when they are in flower; and that you may ſo doe, you muſt firſt obſerue the ſeuerall kindes of them, which doe flower at one and the ſame time, and then to place them in ſuch order and ſo neare one vnto another, that their flowers appearing together of ſeuerall colours, will cauſe the more admiration in the beholders: as thus, The Vernall Crocus or Saffron flowers of the Spring, white, purple, yellow, and ſtript, with ſome Vernall Colchicum or Medow Saffron among them, ſome Deus Caninus or Dogges teeth, and ſome of the ſmall early Leucoium or Bulbous Violet, all planted in ſome proportion as neare one vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as is fit for them, will giue ſuch a grace to the Garden, that the place will ſeeme like a peece of tapeſtry of many glorious colours, to encreaſe euery ones delight: Or elſe many of one ſort together, as the blew, white and bluſh Grape flowers in the ſame manner intermingled, doe make a maruellous delectable ſhew, eſpecially becauſe all of them riſe almoſt to an equall height, which cauſeth the greater grace, as well neare hand as farre of. The like order may be kept with many other things, as the Hepatica, white, blew, purple, and red ſet or ſowne together, will make many to beleeue that one roote doth beare all thoſe colours: But aboue and beyond all others, the Tulipas may be ſo matched, one colour anſwering and ſetting of another, that the place where they ſtand may reſemble a peece of curious needle-worke, or peece of painting: and I haue knowne in a Garden, the Maſter as much commended for this artificiall forme in placing the colours of Tulipas, as for the goodneſſe of his flowers, or any other thing. The diuers ſorts and colours of Anemones or Winde-flowers may be ſo ordered like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which are very beautifull, to haue the ſeuerall varieties planted one neare vnto another, that their ſeuerall colours appearing in one place will be a very great grace in a Garden, or if they be diſperſed among the other ſorts of flowers, they will make a glorious ſhew. Another order in planting you may obſerue; which is this, That thoſe plants that grow low, as the Aconitum Hyemale or Winter-wolues bane, the Vernall Crocus or Saffron-flowers of diuers ſorts, the little early Leucoium or Bulbous Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and ſome ſuch other as riſe not vp high, as alſo ſome Anemones may be very well placed ſomewhat neare or about your Martagons, Lillies, or Crownes Imperiall, both becauſe theſe little plants will flower earlier than they, and ſo will bee gone and paſt, before the other greater plants will riſe vp to any height to hinder them; which is a way may well be admitted in thoſe Gardens that are ſmall, to ſaue roome, and to place things to the moſt aduantage. Thus hauing ſhewed you diuers wayes and orders how to plant your rootes, that your flowers may giue the greater grace in the Garden, let mee ſhew you likewiſe how to ſet theſe kindes of rootes into the ground; for many know not well eyther which end to ſet vpwards or downewards, nor yet to what depth they ſhould be placed in the ground. Daffodils if they be great rootes, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire (as muſt bee obſerued in all other great plants) to bee planted ſomewhat deeper then the ſmaller of the ſame kinde, as alſo that the tops or heads of the rootes be about two or three fingers breadth hid vnderground. The Tulipas likewiſe if you ſet them deepe, they will be the ſafer from froſts if your ground be cold, which will alſo cauſe them to be a little later before they be in flower, yet vſually if the mould be good, they are to be ſet a good hand breadth deep within the ground, ſo that there may be three or foure inches of earth at the leaſt aboue the head, which is the ſmaller end of the roote: for if they ſhall lye too neare the vpper face or cruſt of the earth, the colds &amp; froſts will pierce and pinch them the ſooner. After the ſame order and manner muſt Hyacinthes, whether great or ſmall, and other ſuch great rootes be planted. Your greater rootes, as Martagons, Lillies, and Crownes Imperiall, muſt be ſet much deeper then any other bulbous roote, becauſe they are greater rootes then others, and by themſelues alſo, as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15790:14"/> is moſt vſuall either in ſome ſquare, round, triangle, or other ſmall part in the Garden, becauſe they ſpread and take vp a very great deale of ground. All of them likewiſe are to be ſet with the broad end of the roote downewards, and the ſmall end vpwards, that is, both Lillies, Daffodils, Hyacinthes, and Tulipas, and all other ſorts of round rootes, which ſhew one end to bee ſmaller than another. But the Colchicum or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-Saffron onely requireth an exception to this generall rule, in regard the roote thereof hath a ſmall eminence or part on the one ſide thereof, which muſt bee ſet or planted downeward, and not vpward; for you ſhall obſerue, if the roote lye a little moiſt out of the ground, that it will ſhoote fibres out at the ſmall long end thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you may perceiue when you take it vp, that the fibres were at the other broad end or ſide of the roote. As for the Crowne Imperiall, which is a broad round roote and flat withall, hauing a hole in the middle, for the moſt part quite thorow, when it is taken vp in his due time out of the ground, you ſhall perceiue the ſcales or cloues of the rootes to bee a little open on the vpperſide, and cloſe and flat on the vnderſide, which will direct you which part to ſet vpward, as alſo that the hole is bigger aboue then it is below. The Perſian Lilly is almoſt like vnto the Crowne Imperiall, but that the roote thereof is not ſo flat, and that it hath a ſmaller head at the one part, whereby it may be diſcerned the plainer how to be ſet. The Fritillaria is a ſmall white root di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided as it were into two parts, ſo that many haue doubted, as formerly in the Crowne Imperiall, what part to ſet vppermoſt; you ſhall therefore marke, that the two parts of the roote are ioyned together at the bottome, where it ſhooteth out fibres or ſmall ſtringie rootes, as all other ſorts of bulbous rootes doe, and withall you ſhall ſee, that betweene the two parts of the roote a ſmall head will appeare, which is the burgeon that will ſpring vp to beare leaues and flowers. In the rootes of Anemones there are ſmall round ſwelling heads, eaſie enough to be obſerued if you marke it, which muſt be ſet vpwards. All other ſorts of ſtringie rooted plants (and not bulbous or tuberous rooted) that loſe their greene leaues in Winter, will ſhew a head from whence the leaues and flowers will ſpring, and all others that keepe their greene leaues, are to bee planted in the ſame manner that other herbes and flower-plants are accuſtomed to be. But yet for the better thriuing of the ſtringie rooted plants, when you will plant them, let me informe you of the beſt way of planting, and the moſt ſure to cauſe any plant to comprehend in the ground without failing, and is no common way with any Gardiner in this Kingdome, that euer I heard or knew, which is thus: Preſuming that the ſtringie rooted plant is freſh and not old gathered, and a plant that being remoued will grow againe, make a hole in the ground large enough where you meane to ſet this roote, and raiſe the earth within the hole a little higher in the middle then on the ſides, and ſet the roote thereon, ſpreading the ſtrings all abroad about the middle, that they may as it were couer the middle, and then put the earth gently round about it, preſſing it a little cloſe, and afterwards water it well, if it be in Summer, or in a dry time, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe moderately: thus ſhall euery ſeuerall ſtring of the roote haue earth enough to cauſe it to ſhoote forth, and thereby to encreaſe farre better than by the vſuall way, which is without any great care and reſpect to thruſt the rootes together into the ground. Diuers other flower plants are but annuall, to bee new ſowne euery yeare; as the Maruaile of the world, the Indian Creſſes, or yellow Larkes heeles, the Flower of the Sunne, and diuers other: they therefore that will take pleaſure in them, that they may enioy their flowers the earlier in the yeare, and thereby haue ripe ſeede of them while warme weather laſteth, muſt nurſe vp their ſeedes in a bed of hot dung, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons and Cowcumbers are, but your bed muſt be prouided earlier for theſe ſeeds, than for Melons, &amp;c. that they may haue the more comfort of the Summer, which are to be carefully tended after they are tranſplanted from the hot bed, and couered with ſtraw from colds, whereby you ſhall not faile to gaine ripe ſeed euery yeare, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if you ſhould miſſe of a very kindly &amp; hot Summer, you ſhould neuer haue. Some of theſe ſeedes neede likewiſe to be tranſplanted from the bed of dung vnder a warme wall, as the Flower of the Sunne, and the Maruaile of the world, and ſome others, and that for a while after their tranſplanting, as alſo in the heate of Summer, you water them at the roote with water that hath ſtood a day or two in the Sunne, hauing firſt laid a round wiſpe of hay or ſuch other thing round about the roote, that ſo all helpes may further their giuing of ripe ſeede. One or two rules more I will giue you concerning
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15790:15"/> theſe dainty flowers, the firſt whereof is this, That you ſhall not bee carefull to water any of your bulbous or tuberous rooted plants at any time; for they all of them do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proſper in a dry ground than in a wet, onely all ſorts of tuberous rooted Flower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luces vpon their remouall had neede of a little water, and ſome will doe ſo alſo to ſuch Tulipas and other bulbous rootes as they tranſplant, when they are in flower, and this is I grant in ſome ſort tolerable, if it bee not too much, and done onely to cauſe the ſtalke and flower to abide ſometime the longer before they wither, but elſe in no other caſe to be permitted. The ſecond rule is, That I would aduiſe you to water none of your dainty flowers or herbes, with any water that hath preſently before been drawne out of a well or pumpe, but onely with ſuch water that hath ſtood open in the Sunne in ſome ciſterne, tubbe, or pot for a day at the leaſt, if more the better: for that water which is preſently drawne out of a well, &amp;c. is ſo cold, that it preſently chilleth &amp; kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth any dainty plant be it younger or elder grown, wherof I haue had ſufficient proofe: and therfore I giue you this caution by mine own experience. Thus haue I directed you from point to point, in all the particulars of preparing &amp; planting that belong to this Garden, ſauing only that yet I would further enforme you, of the time of the flowring of theſe Out-landiſh plants, according to the ſeuerall moneths in the yeare, that euery one may know what flowers euery moneth yeeldeth, and may chuſe what them liketh beſt, in that they may ſee hat there is no moneth, but glorieth in ſome peculiar ſorts of rare flowers. I would likewiſe rather in this place ſhew you, the true and beſt manner &amp; order to encreaſe and preſerue all ſorts of Gilloflowers &amp; Carnations, then ioyne it with the Chapter of Gilloflowers in the worke following, becauſe it would in that place take vp too much roome. And laſtly, I muſt of neceſſity oppoſe three ſundry errours, that haue poſſeſſed the mindes of many both in former and later times, which are, that any flower may be made to grow double by art, that was but ſingle before by nature: And that one may by art cauſe any flower to grow of what colour they will: And that any plants may be forced to flower out of their due ſeaſons, either earlier or later, by an art which ſome can vſe. All which being declared. I then ſuppoſe enough is ſpoken for an introduction to this worke, referring many other things to the ſeuerall directions in the Chapters of the booke.</p>

               <p>I Intend in this place onely to giue you briefly, the names of ſome of the chiefeſt of theſe Out-landiſh flowers, according to the ſeuerall moneths of the yeare wherein they flower, that euery one ſeeing what ſorts of flowers euery moneth yeeldeth, may take of them which they like beſt. I begin with Ianuary, as the firſt moneth of the yeare, wherein if the froſts be not extreme, you ſhall haue theſe flowers of plants; the Chriſtmas flower or Helleborus niger verus, Winter wolues bane or Aconitum hye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, Hepatica or Noble Liuer wort blew and red, and of ſhrubbes, the Laurus Tinus or Wilde Bay tree, and Meſereon or the dwarfe Bay: but becauſe Ianuarie is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too deepe in froſts and ſnow, I therefore referre the Hepaticas vnto the moneth following, which is February, wherein the weather beginneth to be a little milder, and then they will flower much better, as alſo diuers ſorts of Crocus or Saffron flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will appeare, the little early Summer foole or Leucoium bulboſum, and towards the latter end thereof the Vernall Colchicum, the Dogges tooth Violet or Deus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, and ſome Anemones, both ſingle and double, which in ſome places will flower all the Winter long. March will yeeld more varieties; for beſides that it holdeth ſome of the flowers of the former moneth, it will yeeld you both the double blew He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patica, and the white and the bluſh ſingle: then alſo you ſhall haue diuers other ſorts of Crocus or Saffron flowers, Double yellow Daffodils, Orientall Iacinths and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Crowne Imperiall, diuers ſorts of early Tulipas, ſome ſorts of French Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlips, both tawney, murry, yellow, and bluſh, the early Fritillaria or checkerd Daffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dill,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15790:15"/> and ſome other ſorts of early Daffodils, and many ſorts of Anemones. In Aprill commeth on the pride of theſe ſtrangers; for herein you may behold all the ſorts of Auricula Vrſi or Beares Eares, many ſorts of Anemones, both ſingle and double, both the ſorts of Tulipas, the earlier vntill the middle of the moneth, and the later then beginning; which are of ſo many different colours, that it is almoſt impoſſible to expreſſe them, the white, red, blacke, and yellow Fritillarias, the Muſcari or Muske Grape flower, both aſh colour and yellow. Diuers other ſorts of Iacinths and Daffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dils, both ſingle and double, the ſmaller ſorts of Flowerdeluces, the Veluet Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluce and double Honyſuckles, with diuers others.

Herein are to bee ſeene at the beginning the middle flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Tulipas, and at the end the later ſort: ſome kindes of Daffodils, the Day Lillies, the great white Starre flower, the Flowerdeluce of Conſtantinople or the mourning Sable flower, the other ſorts of Flowerdeluces. Single and double white Crowfoote, and ſingle and double red Crowfoot, the glory of a Garden: the early red Martagon, the Perſian Lilly, the yellow Martagon, the Gladiolus or Corne flagge, both white, red, and bluſh: the double yellow Roſe, and ſome other ſorts of Roſes.

And euen December it ſelfe will not want the true blacke Hellebor or Chriſtmas flower, and the glorious ſhew of the Laurus Tinus or wilde Bay tree.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The true manner and order to encreaſe and preſerue all ſorts of Gilloflowers, as well by ſlippes as ſeedes.</head>
               <p>BEcauſe that Carnations and Gilloflowers bee the chiefeſt flowers of account in all our Engliſh Gardens, I haue thought good to entreate ſomewhat amply of them, and that a part by it ſelfe, as I ſaid a little before, in regard there is ſo much to be ſaid concerning them, and that if all the matters to be entreated of ſhould haue beene inſerted in the Chapter of Gilloflowers, it would haue made it too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and large, and taken vp too much roome. The particular matters whereof I mean in this place to entreate are theſe: How to encreaſe Gilloflowers by planting and by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15790:16"/> ſowing, and how to preſerue them being encreaſed, both in Summer from noyſome and hurtfull vermine that deſtroy them, and in Winter from froſts, ſnowes, and windes, that ſpoile them. There are two wayes of planting, whereby to encreaſe theſe faire flowers; the one is by ſlipping, which is the old and ready vſuall way, beſt knowne in this Kingdome; the other is more ſure, perfect, ready, and of later inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>videlicet,</hi> by laying downe the branches. The way to encreaſe Gilloflowers by ſlipping, is ſo common with all that euer kept any of them, that I thinke moſt perſons may thinke meidle, to ſpend time to ſet downe in writing that which is ſo well known vnto all: Yet giue me leaue to tell them that ſo might imagine, that (when they haue heard or read what I haue written thereof, if they did know fully as much before) what I here write, was not to informe them, but ſuch as did not know the beſt, or ſo good a way as I teach them: For I am aſſured, the greateſt number doe vſe, and follow the moſt vſuall way, and that is not alwaies the beſt, eſpecially when by good experience a better way is found, and may be learned; and therefore if ſome can doe a thing better than others, I thinke it is no ſhame to learne it of them. You ſhall not then (to take the ſureſt courſe) take any long ſpindled branches, nor thoſe branches that haue any young ſhootes from the ioynts on them, nor yet ſliue or teare any ſlippe or branch from the roote; for all theſe waies are vſuall and common with moſt, which cauſeth ſo many good rootes to rot and periſh, and alſo ſo many ſlippes to be loſt, when as for the moſt part, not the one halfe, or with ſome, not a third part doth grow and thriue of thoſe ſlippes they ſet. And although many that haue ſtore of plants, doe not ſo much care what hauocke they make to gaine ſome, yet to ſaue both labour and plants, I doe wiſh them to obſerue theſe orders: Take from thoſe rootes from whence you intend to make your encreaſe, thoſe ſhootes onely that are reaſonable ſtrong, but yet young, and not either too ſmall and ſlender, or hauing any ſhootes from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When theſe ſlippes are well growne vp, they muſt be tranſplanted into ſuch other places as you thinke meete; that is, either into the ground in beds, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or into pots, which that you may the more ſafely doe, after you haue well wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ground, for halfe a day before you intend to tranſplant them, you ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them ſeuerally, by putting down a broad pointed knife on each ſide of the ſlippe, ſo cutting it out, take euery one by it ſelfe, with the earth cleauing cloſe vnto the root, which by reaſon of the moiſture it had formerly, and that which you gaue preſently before, will be ſufficient with any care had, to cauſe it to hold faſt vnto the roote for the tranſplanting of it: for if the earth were dry, and that it ſhould fall away from the roote in the tranſplanting, it would hazzard and endanger the roote very much, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it did thriue at all. You muſt remember alſo, that vpon the remouing of theſe ſlips, you ſhadow them from the heate of the Sunne for a while with ſome ſtraw or other thing, vntill they haue taken hold in their new place. Thus although it bee a little more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and care than the ordinary way is, yet it is ſurer, and will giue you plants that <pb n="19" facs="tcp:15790:16"/> will be ſo ſtrongly growne before Winter, that with the care hereafter ſpecified, you ſhall haue them beare flowers the next yeare after, and yeeld you encreaſe of ſlippes alſo. To giue you any ſet time, wherein theſe ſlippes will take roote, and begin to ſhoote aboue ground, is very hard to doe; for that euery ſlip, or yet euery kinde of Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loflower is not alike apt to grow; nor is euery earth in like manner fit to produce and bring forward the ſlippes that are ſet therein: but if both the ſlippe be apt to grow, and the earth of the beſt, fit to produce, I thinke within a fortnight or three weekes, you ſhall ſee them begin to put forth young leaues in the middle, or elſe it may be a moneth and more before you ſhall ſee any ſpringing. The beſt time likewiſe when to plant, is a ſpeciall thing to be knowne, and of as great conſequence as any thing elſe: For if you ſlippe and ſet in September, as many vſe to doe, or yet in Auguſt, as ſome may thinke will doe well, yet (vnleſſe they be the moſt ordinary ſorts, which are likely to grow at any time, and in any place) the moſt of them, if not all, will either aſſuredly periſh, or neuer proſper well: for the more excellent and dainty the Gilloflower is, the more tender for the moſt part, and hard to nurſe vp will the ſlippes be. The beſt time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, that you cut off ſuch ſlippes as are likely, and ſuch as your rootes may ſpare, from the beginning of May vntill the middle of Iune at the furtheſt, and order them as I haue ſhewed you before, that ſo you may haue faire plants, plenty of flowers, and encreaſe ſufficient for new ſupply, without offence or loſſe of your ſtore. For the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching likewiſe of your earth, wherein you ſhall plant your ſlippes, that they may the better thriue and proſper, diuers haue vſed diuers ſorts of manure; as ſtable ſoyle of horſe, beaſts or kine, of ſheepe, and pigeons, all which are very good when they are thoroughly turned to mould, to mixe with your other earth, or being ſteeped in water, may ſerue to water the earth at times, and turned in with it. And ſome haue likewiſe proued Tanners earth, that is, their barke, which after they haue vſed, doth lye on heapes and rot in their yards, or the like mould from wood-ſtackes or yards; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and beyond all other is commended the Willow earth, that is, that mould which is found in the hollow of old Willow trees, to be the moſt principall to mixe with other good earth for this purpoſe. And as I haue now giuen you directions for the firſt way to encreaſe them by ſlipping, ſo before I come to the other way, let mee giue you a caueat or two for the preſeruing of them, when they are beginning to runne vtterly to decay and periſh. The one is, that whereas many are ouer greedy to haue their plants to giue them flowers, and therefore let them runne all to flower, ſo farre ſpending themſelues thereby, that after they haue done flowring, they grow ſo weake, hauing out ſpent themſelues, that they cannot poſſibly be preſerued from the iniuries of the ſucceeding Winter; you ſhall therefore keepe the kinde of any ſort you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted withall, if you carefully looke that too many branches doe not runne vp and ſpindle for flowers, but rather either cut ſome of them downe, before they are run vp too high, within two or three ioynts of the rootes; or elſe plucke away the innermoſt leaues where it ſpringeth forwards, which you ſee in the middle of euery branch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be runne vp too high, which will cauſe them to breake out the faſter into ſlips and ſuckers at the ioynts, to hinder their forward luxurie, and to preſerue them the longer: The other is, If you ſhall perceiue any of your Gilloflower leaues to change their naturall freſh verdure, and turne yellowiſh, or begin to wither in anie part or branch thereof, it is a ſure ſigne that the roote is infected with ſome cancker or rottenneſſe, and will ſoone ſhew it ſelfe in all the reſt of the branches, whereby the plant will quickly be loſt: to preſerue it therefore, you ſhall be time, before it be runne too farre, (for otherwiſe it is impoſſible to ſaue it) either couer all or moſt of the branches with freſh earth, or elſe take the faireſt ſlippes from it, as many as you can poſſibly, and caſt them into a pot or tubbe with water, and let them there abide for two or three daies at the leaſt: the firſt way hath recouered many, being taken in time. Thus you ſhall ſee them recouer their former ſtiffeneſſe and colour, and then you may plant them as you haue beene heretofore directed; and although many of them may periſh, yet ſhall you haue ſome of them that will grow to continue the kinde againe. The other or ſecond way to encreaſe Gilloflowers by planting, is, as I ſaid before, by in laying or laying downe the branches of them, and is a way of later inuention, and as frequently vſed, not onely for the tawney or yellow Gilloflower, and all the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therof, but with the other kinds of Gilloflowers, whereof experience hath ſhewed <pb n="20" facs="tcp:15790:17"/> that they will likewiſe take if they be ſo vſed; the manner whereof is thus: You muſt chooſe out the youngeſt, likelieſt, and loweſt branches that are neareſt the ground (for the vpper branches will ſooner breake at the ioynt, than bend downe ſo low into the earth, without ſome pot with earth raiſed vp vnto them) and cut it on the vnderſide thereof vpwards at the ſecond ioynt next vnto the roote, to the middle of the branch, and no more, and not quite thorough in any caſe, and then from that ſecond ioynt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third, ſlit or cut the branch in the middle longwiſe, that ſo it may be the more eaſily bended into the ground, the cut ioynt ſeeming like the end of a ſlippe, when you haue bended downe the branch where it is cut into the ground (which muſt bee done very gently for feare of breaking) with a little ſticke or two thruſt ſlopewiſe, croſſe ouer it, keepe it downe within the earth, and raiſe vp ſufficient earth ouer it, that there it may lye and take roote, which commonly will be effected within ſixe weekes or two moneths in the Summer time, and then (or longer if you doubt the time too ſhort for it to take ſufficient roote) you may take or cut it away, and tranſplant it where you thinke good, yet ſo as in any caſe you ſhadow it from the heate of the Sunne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it haue taken good hold in the ground. The other way to encreaſe Gilloflowers, is by ſowing the ſeede: It is not vſuall with all ſorts of Gilloflowers to giue ſeede, but ſuch of them as doe yeeld ſeede may be encreaſed thereby, in the ſame manner as is here ſet downe. The Orange tawney Gilloflower and the varieties thereof is the moſt vſuall kinde, (and it is a kinde by it ſelfe, how various ſoeuer the plants be that riſe from the ſeede) that doth giue ſeede, and is ſowne, and from thence ariſeth ſo many varieties of colours, both plaine and mixt, both ſingle and double, that one can hardly ſet them downe in writing: yet ſuch as I haue obſerued and marked, you ſhall finde expreſſed in the Chapter of Gilloflowers in the worke following. Firſt therefore make choiſe of your ſeede that you intend to ſowe (if you doe not deſire to haue as many more ſingle flowers as double) that it bee taken from double flowers, and not from ſingle, and from the beſt colours, howſoeuer ſome may boaſt to haue had double and ſtript flowers from the ſeede of a ſingle one; which if it were ſo, yet one Swallow (as we ſay) maketh no Summer, nor a thing comming by chance cannot bee reckoned for a certaine and conſtant rule; you may be aſſured they will not vſually doe ſo: but the beſt, faireſt, and moſt double flowers come alwaies, or for the moſt part, from the ſeede of thoſe flowers that were beſt, faireſt, and moſt double, and I doe aduiſe you to take the beſt and moſt double: for euen from them you ſhall haue ſingle ones e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now, you neede not to ſowe any worſer ſort. And againe, ſee that your ſeede bee new, of the laſt yeares gathering, and alſo that it was full ripe before it was gathered, leſt you loſe your labour, or miſſe of your purpoſe, which is, to haue faire and double flowers. Hauing now made choiſe of your ſeede, and prepared you a bedde to ſowe them on, the earth whereof muſt be rich and good, and likewiſe ſifted to make it the finer; for the better it is, the better ſhall your profit and pleaſure bee: hereon, being firſt made leuell, plaine, and ſmooth, ſowe your ſeede ſomewhat thinne, and not too thicke in any caſe, and as euenly as you can, that they be not too many in one place, and too few in another, which afterwards couer with fine ſifted earth ouer them about one fingers thickneſſe; let this be done in the middle of Aprill, if the time of the yeare be temperate, and not too cold, or elſe ſtay vntill the end of the moneth: after they are ſprung vp and growne to be ſomewhat bigge, let them bee drawne forth that are too cloſe and neare one vnto another, and plant them in ſuch place where they ſhall continue, ſo that they ſtand halfe a yard of ground diſtance aſunder, which after the planting, let be ſhadowed for a time, as is before ſpecified; and this may bee done in the end of Iuly, or ſooner if there becauſe. I haue not ſet downe in all this diſcourſe of planting, tranſplanting, ſowing, ſetting, &amp;c. any mention of watering thoſe ſlips or plants, not doubting but that euery ones reaſon will induce them to thinke, that they cannot proſper without watering: But let this Caueat be a ſufficient remembrance vnto you, that you neuer water any of theſe Gilloflowers, nor yet indeede any other fine herbe or plant with cold water, ſuch as you haue preſently before drawne out from a pumpe or Well, &amp;c. but with ſuch water as hath ſtood open in the aire in a ciſterne, tubbe, or pot, for one whole day at the leaſt; if it be two or three daies it will be neuer the worſe, but rather the better, as I haue related before: yet take eſpeciall heede that you doe not giue them too much to ouer-glut them at any time, but temperately to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorate, <pb n="21" facs="tcp:15790:17"/> bedew or ſprinkle them often. From the ſeedes of theſe Gilloflowers hath ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen both white, red, bluſh, ſtamell, tawny lighter and ſadder, marbled, ſpeckled, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, flaked, and that in diuers manners, both ſingle and double flowers, as you ſhall ſee them ſet downe in a more ample manner in the Chapter of Gilloflowers. And thus much for their encreaſe by the two wayes of planting and ſowing: For as for a third way, by grafting one into or vpon another, I know none ſuch to be true, nor to be of any more worth than an old Wiues tale, both nature, reaſon, and experience, all conteſting againſt ſuch an idle fancy, let men make what oſtentation they pleaſe. It now reſteth, that we alſo ſhew you the manner how to preſerue them, as well in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer from all noyſome and hurtfull things, as in the Winter and Spring from the ſharp and chilling colds, and the ſharpe and bitter killing windes in March. The hurtfull things in the Summer are eſpecially theſe, too much heate of the Sunne which ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, which you muſt be carefull to preuent, by placing boughes, boords, clothes or mats, &amp;c. before them, if they bee in the ground; or elſe if they bee in pots, to remoue into them into the ſhadow, to giue them refreſhing from the heate, and giue them water alſo for their life: too much water, or too little is another annoyance, which you muſt order as you ſee there is iuſt cauſe, by withholding or giuing them wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gently out of a watering pot, and not caſt on by diſhfuls: Some alſo to water their Gilloflowers, vſe to ſet their pots into tubbes or pots halfe full of water, that ſo the water may ſoake in at the lower holes in each flower pot, to giue moiſture to the roots of the Gilloflowers onely, without caſting any water vpon the leaues, and aſſuredly it is an excellent way to moiſten the rootes ſo ſufficiently at one time, that it doth ſaue a great deale of paines many other times. Earwickes are a moſt infeſtuous vermine, to ſpoyle the whole beauty of your flowers, and that in one night or day; for theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures delighting to creepe into any hollow or ſhadowie place, doe creepe into the long greene pods of the Gilloflowers, and doe eate away the white bottomes of their leaues, which are ſweete, whereby the leaues of the flowers being looſe, doe either fall away of themſelues before, or when they are gathered, or handled, or preſently wither within the pods before they are gathered, and blowne away with the winde. To auoide which inconuenience, many haue deuiſed many waies and inuentions to deſtroy them, as pots with double verges or brimmes, containing a hollow gutter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, which being filled with water, will not ſuffer theſe ſmall vermine to paſſe ouer it to the Gilloflowers to ſpoile them. Others haue vſed old ſhooes, and ſuch like hollow things to bee ſet by them to take them in: but the beſt and moſt vſuall things now vſed, are eyther long hollow canes, or elſe beaſts hoofes, which being turned downe vpon ſtickes ends ſet into the ground, or into the pots of earth, will ſoone draw into them many Earwickes, lying hid therein from ſunne, winde, and raine, and by care and diligence may ſoone bee deſtroyed, if euery morning and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one take the hoofes gently off from the ſtickes, and knocking them againſt the ground in a plain allie, ſhake out all the Earwicks that are crept into them, which quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ones foot may be trode to peeces. For ſodain blaſting with thunder and lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or fierce ſharpe windes, &amp;c. I know no other remedy, vnleſſe you can couer them therefrom when you firſt foreſee the danger, but patiently to abide the loſſe, whatſoeuer ſome haue aduiſed, to lay litter about them to auoide blaſting; for if any ſhall make tryall thereof, I am in doubt, he ſhall more endanger his rootes thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Summer time, when any ſuch feare of blaſting is, than any wiſe ſaue them from it, or doe them any good. For the Winter preſeruation of them, ſome haue aduiſed to couer them with Bee-hiues, or elſe with ſmall Willow ſtickes, prickt croſſewiſe into the ground ouer your flowers, and bowed archwiſe, and with litter laid thereon, to couer the Gilloflowers quite ouer, after they haue beene ſprinkled with ſope aſhes and lyme mixt together: and this way is commended by ſome that haue written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be ſuch an admirable defence vnto them in Winter, that neither Ants, nor Snailes, nor Earwickes ſhall touch them, becauſe of the ſope aſhes and lyme, and ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther froſts nor ſtormes ſhall hurt them, becauſe of the litter which ſo well will defend them; and hereby alſo your Gilloflowers will bee ready to flower, not onely in the Spring very early, but euen all the Winter. But whoſoeuer ſhall follow theſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may peraduenture finde them in ſome part true, as they are there ſet downe for the Winter time, and while they are kept cloſe and couered; but let them bee aſſured, <pb n="22" facs="tcp:15790:18"/> that all ſuch plants, or the moſt part of them, will certainely periſh and dye before the Summer be at an end: for the ſope aſhes and lyme will burne vp and ſpoile any herbe; and againe, it is impoſſible for any plant that is kept ſo warme in Winter, to abide ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cold or the winde in the Spring following, or any heate of the Sun, but that both of them will ſcorch them, and carry them quite away. One great hurt vnto them, and to all other herbes that wee preſerue in Winter, is to ſuffer the ſnow to lye vpon them any time after it is fallen, for that it doth ſo chill them, that the Sunne afterward, although in Winter, doth ſcorch them and burne them vp: looke therefore vnto your Gilloflowers in thoſe times, and ſhake or ſtrike off the ſnow gently off from them, not ſuffering it to abide on them any day or night if you can; for aſſure your ſelfe, if it doth not abide on them, the better they will be. The froſts likewiſe is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great annoyance vnto them, to corrupt the rootes, and to cauſe them to ſwell, rot, and breake: to preuent which inconuenience, I would aduiſe you to take the ſtraw or litter of your horſe ſtable, and lay ſome thereof about euery roote of your Gillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers (eſpecially thoſe of the beſt account) cloſe vnto them vpon the ground, but be as carefull as you can, that none thereof lye vpon the greene leaues, or as little as may be, and by this onely way haue they been better defended from the froſts that ſpoile them in Winter, then by any other that I haue ſeen or knowne. The windes in March, and Sunneſhine dayes then, are one of the greateſt inconueniences that happeneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: for they that haue had hundreds of plants, that haue kept faire and greene all the Winter vntill the beginning or middle of March, before the end thereof, haue had ſcarce one of many, that either hath not vtterly periſhed, or been ſo tainted, that quickly after haue not been loſt; which hath happened chiefly by the neglect of theſe cautions before ſpecified, or in not defending them from the bitter ſharpe windes and ſunne in this moneth of March. You ſhall therefore for their better preſeruation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the litter laid about the rootes, which I aduiſe you not to remoue as yet, ſhelter them ſomewhat from the windes, with eyther bottomleſſe pots, pales, or ſuch like things, to keep away the violent force both of windes and ſun for that moneth, and for ſometime before &amp; after it alſo: yet ſo, that they be not couered cloſe aboue, but open to receiue ayre &amp; raine. Some alſo vſe to wind withes of hey or ſtraw about the rootes of their Gilloflowers, and faſten them with ſtickes thruſt into the ground, which ſerue very well in the ſtead of the other. Thus haue I ſhewed you the whole preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe worthy and dainty flowers, with the whole manner of ordering them for their encreaſe: if any one haue any other better way, I ſhall be as willing to learne it of them, as I haue beene to giue them or any others the knowledge of that I haue here ſet downe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> That there is not any art whereby any flower may be made to grow double, that was naturally ſingle, nor of any other ſent or colour than it firſt had by nature; nor that the ſowing or planting of herbes one deeper than other, will cauſe them to be in flower one after another, euery moneth in the yeare.</head>
               <p>THe wonderfull deſire that many haue to ſee faire, double, and ſweete flowers, hath tranſported them beyond both reaſon and nature, feigning and boaſting often of what they would haue, as if they had it. And I thinke, from this deſire and boaſting hath riſen all the falſe tales and reports, of making flowers double as they liſt, and of giuing them colour and ſent as they pleaſe, and to flower likewiſe at what time they will, I doubt not, but that ſome of theſe errours are ancient, and continued long by tradition, and others are of later inuention: and therefore the more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that men of wit and iudgement in theſe dayes ſhould expoſe themſelues in their writings, to be rather laughed at, then beleeued for ſuch idle tales. And although in the contradiction of them, I know I ſhall vndergoe many calumnies, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I will endeauour to ſet downe and declare ſo much, as I hope may by reaſon <pb n="23" facs="tcp:15790:18"/> perſwade many in the truth, although I cannot hope of all, ſome being ſo ſtrongly wedded to their owne will, and the errours they haue beene bred in, that no reaſon may alter them. Firſt therefore I ſay, that if there were any art to make ſome flowers to grow double, that naturally were ſingle, by the ſame art, all ſorts of flowers that are ſingle by nature, may be made to grow double: but the ſorts of flowers that are ſingle by nature, whereof ſome are double, were neuer made double by art; for many ſorts abide ſtill ſingle, whereof there was neuer ſeene double: and therefore there is no ſuch art in any mans knowledge to bring it to paſſe. If any man ſhall ſay, that becauſe there are many flowers double, whereof there are ſingle alſo of the ſame kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, as for example, Violets, Marigolds, Daiſyes, Daffodils, Anemones, and many other, that therefore thoſe double flowers were ſo made by the art of man: <hi>viz.</hi> by the obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the change of the Moone, the conſtellations or coniunctions of Planets, or ſome other Starres or celeſtiall bodies. Although I doe confeſſe and acknowledge, that I thinke ſome conſtellations, and peraduenture changes of the Moone, &amp;c. were appointed by the God of nature, as conducing and helping to the making of thoſe flowers double, that nature hath ſo produced; yet I doe deny, that any man hath or ſhall euer be able to proue, that it was done by any art of man, or that any man can tell the true cauſes and ſeaſons, what changes of the Moone, or conſtellations of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, wrought together for the producing of thoſe double flowers, or can imitate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or rather the God of nature, to doe the like. If it ſhall bee demanded, From whence then came theſe double flowers that we haue, if they were not ſo made by art? I anſwer, that aſſuredly all ſuch flowers did firſt grow wilde, and were ſo found dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as they doe now grow in Gardens, but for how long before they were found they became double, no man can tell; we onely haue them as nature hath produced them, and ſo they remaine. Againe, if any ſhall ſay, that it is likely that theſe double flowers were forced ſo to be, by the often planting and tranſplanting of them, becauſe it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in moſt of them, that if they ſtand long in any one place, and not be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, they will grow ſtill leſſe double, and in the end turne ſingle. I doe confeſſe, that <hi>Facilior eſt deſcenſus quàm aſcenſus,</hi> and that the vnfruitfulneſſe of the ground they are planted in, or the neglect or little care had of them, or the growing of them too thicke or too long, are oftentimes a cauſe of the diminiſhing of the flowers doubleneſſe; but withall you ſhall obſerue, that the ſame rootes that did beare double flowers (and not any other that neuer were double before) haue returned to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doubleneſſe againe, by good ordering and looking vnto: ſingle flowers haue only beene made ſomewhat fairer or larger, by being planted in the richer and more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ground of the Garden, than they were found wilde by nature; but neuer made to grow double, as that which is naturally ſo found of it ſelfe: For I will ſhew you mine owne experience in the matter. I haue been as inquiſitiue as any man might be, with euery one I knew, that made any ſuch report, or that I thought could ſay any thing therein, but I neuer could finde any one, that could aſſuredly reſolue me, that he knew certainly any ſuch thing to be done: all that they could ſay was but report, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the Moone, to remoue plants before the change, that is, as ſome ſay, the full of the Moone, others the new Moone, whereupon I haue made tryall at many times, and in many ſorts of plants, accordingly, and as I thought fit, by planting &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplanting them, but I could neuer ſee the effect deſired, but rather in many of them the loſſe of my plants. And were there indeed ſuch a certaine art, to make ſingle flowers to grow double, it would haue beene knowne certainly to ſome that would practiſe it, and there are ſo many ſingle flowers, whereof there were neuer any of the kinde ſeene double, that to produce ſuch of them to be double, would procure both credit and coyne enough to him that ſhould vſe it; but <hi>Vltra poſſe non eſt eſſe:</hi> and therefore let no man beleeue any ſuch reports, bee they neuer ſo ancient; for they are but meere tales and fables. Concerning colours and ſents, the many rules and directions extant in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie mens writings, to cauſe flowers to grow yellow, red, greene, or white, that neuer were ſo naturally, as alſo to be of the ſent of Cinamon, Muske, &amp;c. would almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any, that the matters thus ſet downe by ſuch perſons, and with ſome ſhew of probability, were conſtant and aſſured proofes thereof: but when they come to the triall, they all vaniſh away like ſmoake. I will in a few words ſhew you the matters and manners of their proceedings to effect this purpoſe: Firſt (they ſay) if you ſhall ſteepe <pb n="24" facs="tcp:15790:19"/> your ſeedes in the lees of red Wine, you ſhall haue the flowers of thoſe plants to be of a purple colour. If you will haue Lillies or Gilloflowers to be of a Scarlet red colour, you ſhall put Vermillion or Cynaber betweene the rinde and the ſmall heads growing about the roote: if you will haue them blew, you ſhall diſſolue Azur or Byſe between the rinde and the heads: if yellow, Orpiment: if greene, Vardigreaſe, and thus of any other colour. Others doe aduiſe to open the head of the roote, and poure into it any colour diſſolued, ſo that there be no fretting or corroding thing therein for feare of hurting the roote, and looke what colour you put in, iuſt ſuch or neare vnto it ſhall the colour of the flower bee. Some againe doe aduiſe to water the plants you would haue changed, with ſuch coloured liquor as you deſire the flower to be of, and they ſhall grow to be ſo. Alſo to make Roſes to bee yellow, that you ſhould graft a white Roſe (ſome ſay a Damaske) vpon a Broome ſtalke, and the flower will be yellow, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing becauſe the Broome flower is yellow, therefore the Roſe will be yellow. Some affirme the like, if a Roſe be grafted on a Barbery buſh, becauſe both the bloſſome and the barke of the Barbery is yellow, &amp;c. In the like manner for ſents, they haue ſet downe in their writings, that by putting Cloues, Muske, Cinamon, Benzoin, or any other ſuch ſweete thing, bruiſed with Roſe water, between the barke and the body of trees, the fruit of them will ſmell and taſte of the ſame that is put vnto them; and if they bee put vnto the toppe of the rootes, or elſe bound vnto the head of the roote, they will cauſe the flowers to ſmell of that ſent the matter put vnto them is of: as alſo to ſteep the ſeeds of Roſes, and other plants in the water of ſuch like ſweet things, and then to ſowe them, and water them morning and euening with ſuch like liquor, vntill they be growne vp; beſides a number of ſuch like rules and directions ſet downe in bookes, ſo confidently, as if the matters were without all doubt or queſtion: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as without all doubt and queſtion I will aſſure you, that they are all but meere idle tales &amp; fancies, without all reaſon or truth, or ſhadow of reaſon or truth: For ſents and colours are both ſuch qualities as follow the eſſence of plants, euen as formes are alſo; and one may as well make any plant to grow of what forme you will, as to make it of what ſent or colour you will; and if any man can forme plants at his will and pleaſure, he can doe as much as God himſelfe that created them. For the things they would adde vnto the plants to giue them colour, are all corporeall, or of a bodily ſubſtance, and whatſoeuer ſhould giue any colour vnto a liuing and growing plant, muſt be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall: for no ſolide corporeall ſubſtance can ioyne it ſelfe with the life and eſſence of an herbe or tree, and the ſpirituall part of the colour thereof is not the ſame with the bodily ſubſtance, but is a meere vapour that riſeth from the ſubſtance, and feedeth the plant, whereby it groweth, ſo that there is no ground or colour of reaſon, that a ſubſtantiall colour ſhould giue colour to a growing herbe or tree: but for ſent (which is a meere vapour) you will ſay there is more probability. Yet conſider alſo, that what ſweete ſent ſoeuer you binde or put vnto the rootes of herbes or trees, muſt be either buried, or as good as buried in the earth, or barke of the tree, whereby the ſubſtance will in a ſmall time corrupt and rot, and before it can ioyne it ſelfe with the life, ſpirit, and eſſence of the plant, the ſent alſo will periſh with the ſubſtance: For no heterogeneall things can bee mixed naturally together, as Iron and Clay; and no other thing but homogeneall, can be nouriſhment or conuertible into the ſubſtance of man or beaſt: And as the ſtomach of man or beaſt altereth both formes, ſents, and colours of all digeſtible things; ſo whatſoeuer ſent or colour is wholſome, and not poyſonfull to nature, being receiued into the body of man or beaſt, doth neither change the bloud or skinne into that colour or ſent was receiued: no more doth any colour or ſent to any plant; for the plants are onely nouriſhed by the moiſture they draw naturally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, be it of wine or any other liquor is put vnto them, and not by any corporeall ſubſtance, or heterogeneall vapour or ſent, becauſe the earth like vnto the ſtomach doth ſoone alter them, before they are conuerted into the nature and ſubſtance of the plant. Now for the laſt part I vndertooke to confute, that no man can by art make all flowers to ſpring at what time of the yeare hee will; although, as I haue here before ſhewed, there are flowers for euery moneth of the yeare, yet I hope there is not any one, that hath any knowledge in flowers and gardening, but knoweth that the flowers that appeare and ſhew themſelues in the ſeuerall moneths of the yeare, are not one and the ſame, and ſo made to flower by art; but that they are ſeuerall ſorts of plants, which <pb n="25" facs="tcp:15790:19"/> will flower naturally and conſtantly in the ſame moneths one yeare, that they vſe to doe in another, or with but little alteration, if the yeares proue not alike kindly: As for example, thoſe plants that doe flower in Ianuary and February, will by no art or induſtry of man be cauſed to flower in Summer or in Autumne; and thoſe that flower in Aprill and May, will not flower in Ianuary or February; or thoſe in Iuly, Auguſt, &amp;c. either in the Winter or Spring: but euery one knoweth their owne appointed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall times, which they conſtantly obſerue and keepe, according to the temperature of the yeare, or the temper of the climate, being further North or South, to bring them on earlier or later, as it doth with all other fruits, flowers, and growing greene herbes, &amp;c. except that by chance, ſome one or other extraordinarily may be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their due ſeaſon of flowring, and ſo giue their flowers out of time, or elſe to giue their flowers twice in the yeare, by the ſuperaboundance of nouriſhment, or the mildneſſe of the ſeaſon, by moderate ſhowers of raine, &amp;c. as it ſometimes alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth with fruits, which chance, as it is ſeldome, and not conſtant, ſo we then terme it but <hi>Luſus naturae:</hi> or elſe by forcing them in hot ſtoues, which then will periſh, when they haue giuen their flowers or fruits. It is not then, as ſome haue written, the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſeedes of Lillies, or any other plants a foote deepe, or halfe a foote deepe, or two inches deepe, that will cauſe them to be in flower one after another, as they are ſowne euery moneth of the yeare; for it were too groſſe to thinke, that any man of reaſon and iudgement would ſo beleeue. Nor is it likewiſe in the power of any man, to make the ſame plants to abide a moneth, two, or three, or longer in their beauty of flowring, then naturally they vſe to doe; for I thinke that were no humane art, but a ſupernaturall worke. For nature ſtill bendeth and tendeth to perfection, that is, after flowring to giue fruit or ſeede; nor can it bee hindered in the courſe thereof without manifeſt danger of deſtruction, euen as it is in all other fruit-bearing creatures, which ſtay no longer, then their appointed time is naturall vnto them, without apparent damage. Some things I grant may be ſo ordered in the planting, that according to that order and time which is obſerued in their planting, they ſhall ſhew forth their faire flowers, and they are Anemones, which will in that manner, that I haue ſhewed in the worke following, flower in ſeuerall moneths of the yeare; which thing as it is incident to none or very few other plants, and is found out but of late, ſo likewiſe is it knowne but vnto a very few. Thus haue I ſhewed you the true ſolution of theſe doubts: And although they haue not beene amplified with ſuch Philoſophicall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and reaſons, as one of greater learning might haue done, yet are they truely and ſincerely ſet downe, that they may ſerue <hi>tanquam galcatum,</hi> againſt all the calumnies and obiections of wilfull and obdurate perſons, that will not be reformed. As firſt, that all double flowers were ſo found wilde, being the worke of nature alone, and not the art of any man, by planting or tranſplanting, at or before the new or full Moone, or any other obſeruation of time, that hath cauſed the flower to grow double, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally was ſingle: Secondly, that the rules and directions, to cauſe flowers to bee of contrary or different colours or ſents, from that they were or would be naturally, are meere fancies of men, without any ground of reaſon or truth. And thirdly, that there is no power or art in man, to cauſe flowers to ſhew their beauty diuers moneths before their naturall time, nor to abide in their beauty longer then the appointed naturall time for euery one of them.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe the Lilly is the more ſtately flower among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: and amongſt the wonderfull varietie of Lillies, knowne to vs in theſe daies, much more then in former times, whereof ſome are white, others bluſh, ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, others red or yellow, ſome ſpotted, others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpots, ſome ſtanding vpright, others hanging or turning downewards, The Crowne Imperiall for his ſtately beautifulneſs, deſerueth the firſt place in this our Garden of delight, to be here entreated of before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lillies: but becauſe it is ſo well knowne to moſt perſons, being in a manner euery where common, I ſhall neede onely to giue you a relation of the chiefe parts thereof (as I intend in ſuch other things) which are theſe: The roote is yellowiſh on the outſide, compoſed of fewer, but much thicker ſcales, then any other Lilly but the Perſian, and doth grow ſometimes to be as great as a pretty bigge childes head, but ſomewhat flat withall, from the ſides whereof, and not from the bottome, it ſhooteth forth thicke long fibres, which periſh euery yeare, hauing a hole in the midſt thereof, at the end of the yeare, when the old ſtalke is dry and withered, and out of the which a new ſtalke doth ſpring againe (from a bud or head to be ſeen within the hollowneſſe on the one ſide) the yeare following: the ſtalke then filling vp the hollowneſſe, riſeth vp three or foure foote high, being great, round, and of a purpliſh colour at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, but greene aboue, beſet from thence to the middle thereof with many long and broad greene leaues, very like to the leaues of our ordinary white Lilly, but ſomewhat ſhorter and narrower, confuſedly without order, and from the middle is bare or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked without leaues, for a certaine ſpace vpwards, and then beareth foure, ſixe, or tenne flowers, more or leſſe, according to the age of the plant, and the fertility of the ſoyle where it groweth: The buddes at the firſt appearing are whitiſh, ſtanding vpright a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a buſh or tuft of greene leaues, ſmaller then thoſe below, and ſtanding aboue the flowers, after a while they turne themſelues, and hang downewards euerie one vpon his owne footeſtalke, round about the great ſtemme or ſtalke, ſometimes of an euen depth, and other while one lower or higher than another, which flowers are neare the forme of an ordinary Lilly, yet ſomewhat leſſer and cloſer, conſiſting of ſixe leaues of an Orange colour, ſtriped with purpliſh lines and veines, which adde a great grace to the flowers: At the bottome of the flower next vnto the ſtalke, euery <pb n="28" facs="tcp:15790:21"/> leafe thereof hath on the outſide a certaine bunch or eminence, of a darke purpliſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and on the inſide there lyeth in thoſe hollow bunched places, certaine cleare drops of water like vnto pearles, of a very ſweete taſte almoſt like ſugar: in the midſt of each flower is a long white ſtile or pointell, forked or diuided at the end, and ſixe white chiues tipt with yellowiſh pendents, ſtanding cloſe about it: after the flowers are paſt, appeare ſixe ſquare ſeede veſſels ſtanding vpright, winged as it were or welted on the edges, yet ſeeming but three ſquare, becauſe each couple of thoſe welted edges are ioyned cloſer together, wherein are contained broad, flat, and thinne ſeedes, of a pale browniſh colour, like vnto other Lillies, but much greater and thicker alſo. The ſtalke of this plant doth oftentimes grow flat, two, three, or foure fingers broad, and then beareth many more flowers, but for the moſt part ſmaller then when it beareth round ſtalkes. And ſometimes it happeneth the ſtalke to be diuided at the top, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two or three tufts of greene leaues, without any flowers on them. And ſometimes likewiſe, to beare two or three rowes or crownes of flowers one aboue another vpon one ſtalke, which is ſeldome and ſcarce ſeene, and beſides, is but meere accidentall: the whole plant and euery part thereof, as well rootes, as leaues and flowers, doe ſmell ſomewhat ſtrong as it were the ſauour of a Foxe, ſo that if any doe but come neare it, he cannot but ſmell it, which yet is not vnwholſome.</p>
                  <p>I haue not obſerued any variety in the colour of this flower, more then that it will be fairer in a cleare open ayre, and paler, or as it were blaſted in a muddy or ſmoakie ayre. And although ſome haue boaſted of one with white flowers, yet I could neuer heare that any ſuch hath endured in one vniforme colour.</p>

                  <p>VNder this title of <hi>Lilium Montanum,</hi> or <hi>Lilium Silueſtre,</hi> I do comprehend only thoſe kindes of Lillies, which carry diuers circles of greene leaues ſet together at certaine diſtances, round about the ſtalke, and not ſparſedly as the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and as other kindes that follow, doe. And although there bee many of this ſort, yet becauſe their chiefeſt difference is in the colour of the flower, wee will containe them all in one Chapter, and begin with the moſt ſtately of them all, becauſe of the number of flowers it beareth vpon one ſtalke. The Imperiall Lilly hath a ſcaly roote, like vnto all the reſt of the Lillies, but of a paler yellow colour, cloſely compact or ſet together, being ſhort and ſmall oftentimes, in compariſon of the greatneſſe of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15790:22"/> ſtemme growing from it. The ſtalke is browniſh and round at the bottome, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flat from the middle vpwards, three foote high or more, beſet at certaine diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with rondles or circles of many broad leaues, larger and broader for the moſt part than any other of this kinde, and of a darke green colour: It hath two or three, and ſometimes foure of theſe rondles or circles of leaues, and bare without any leafe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene; but aboue toward the tops of the ſtalkes, it hath here and there ſome leaues vpon it, but ſmaller than any of the other leaues: at the toppe of the ſtalke come forth many flowers, ſometime three or foure ſcore, thicke thruſt, or confuſedly ſet together, and not thinne or ſparſedly one aboue another, as in the leſſer of this kinde of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lilly. It hath been ſometimes alſo obſerued in this kinde, that it hath borne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie flowers at three ſeuerall ſpaces of the ſtalke, one aboue another, which hath made a goodly ſhew; each flower whereof is pendulous, hanging downe, and each leafe of the flower turning vp againe, being thicke or fleſhy, of a fine delayed purple colour, ſpotted with many blackiſh or browniſh ſpots, of a very pleaſant ſweet ſent, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it the more acceptable: in the middle of the flower hangeth downe a ſtile or pointell, knobbed or buttoned at the end with ſixe yellow chiues, tipt with looſe pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of an Orient red or Vermillion colour, which will eaſily ſticke like duſt vpon any thing that toucheth them: the heads or ſeede veſſels are ſmall and round, with ſmall edges about them, wherein is contained flat browne ſeede like other Lillies, but leſſer. The root is very apt to encreaſe or ſet of, as we call it, wherby the plant ſeldome commeth to ſo great a head of flowers, but riſeth vp with many ſtalkes, and then carry fewer flowers.</p>
                  <p>Of this kinde there is ſometimes one found, that beareth flowers without any ſpots:<note place="margin">Martagon Imperiale flore non pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctato.</note> the leaues whereof and ſtalke likewiſe are paler, but not elſe differing.</p>

There are not onely diuers kindes of Tulipas, but ſundry diuerſities of colours in them, found out in theſe later dayes by many the ſearchers of natures va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, which haue not formerly been obſerued: our age being more delighted in the ſearch, curioſity, and rarities of theſe pleaſant delights, then any age I thinke before.

<hi>Serotinae</hi> then with the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> not onely in the colour of the leafe, being of the ſame greenneſſe with the <hi>Serotinae,</hi> and moſt vſually alſo, for that it beareth his ſtalke and flower, high and large like as the <hi>Serotinae</hi> doe; but eſpecially, for that the ſeede of a <hi>Media Tulipa</hi> did neuer bring forth a <hi>Praecox</hi> flower (although I know Cluſius, an induſtrious, learned, and painfull ſearcher and publiſher of theſe rarities, ſaith otherwiſe) ſo farre as euer I could, by mine owne care or knowledge, in ſowing their ſeede apart, or the aſſurance of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the louers and ſowers of Tulipa ſeede, obſerue, learne, or know: and becauſe alſo that the ſeede of the <hi>Serotinae</hi> bringeth forth <hi>Medias,</hi> and the ſeede of
<hi>Medias Sero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinae,</hi> they may well bee comprehended vnder the generall title of <hi>Serotinae:</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue generally receiued the name of <hi>Media,</hi> or middle flowring Tulipas, to diſtinguiſh betweene them, and thoſe that vſually doe flower after them; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſet them downe, and ſpeake of them ſeuerally, as of three ſorts. Vnto the place and ranke likewiſe of the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> or early flowring Tulipas, there are ſome other ſeuerall kinds of Tulipas to be added, which are notably differing, not onely from the former <hi>Praecox Tulipa,</hi> but euery one of them, one from another, in ſome ſpeciall note or other: as the
<hi>Tulipa Bolonienſis flore rubro,</hi> the red Bolonia Tulipa. <hi>Tulipa Bolonienſis flore luteo,</hi> the yellow Bolonia Tulipa. <hi>Tulipa Perſica,</hi> the Perſian Tulipa. <hi>Tulipa Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> the Candie Tulipa, and others: all which ſhall bee deſcribed and entreated of, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one apart by it ſelfe, in the end of the ranke of the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> becauſe all of them flower much about their time. To begin then with the
<hi>Praecox,</hi> or early flowring Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipas, and after them with the
<hi>Medias</hi> and <hi>Serotines,</hi> I ſhall for the better method, diuide their flowers into foure primary or principall colours, that is to ſay, White, Purple, Red, and Yellow, and vnder euery one of theſe colours, ſet downe the ſeuerall varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <pb n="46" facs="tcp:15790:30"/> of mixtures we haue ſeene and obſerued in them, that ſo they may be both the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſcribed by me, and the better conceiued by others, and euery one placed in their proper ranke. Yet I ſhall in this, as I intend to doe in diuers other plants that are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, giue but one deſcription in generall of the plant, and then ſet downe the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of forme or colour afterwards briefly by themſelues.</p>

It ſhooteth out of the ground with broad and long leaues, like the former; but neither ſo broad, nor of ſo white or mealy a greene colour as the former, but more darke then the late flowring Tulipa, ſo that this may bee eaſily diſcerned by his leafe from any other Tulipa aboue the ground, by one that is skilfull. It beareth likewiſe three or foure leaues vpon the ſtalke, like the former, and a flower alſo at the toppe of the ſame faſhion, but that the leaues hereof are alwayes long, and ſomewhat narrow, hauing a large blacke bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, made like vnto a cheuerne, the point whereof riſeth vp vnto the middle of the leafe, higher then any other Tulipa; the flower is of a pale red colour, nothing ſo liuely as in the early or late red Tulipas, yet ſweeter for the moſt part then any of them, and neereſt vnto the yellow Bolonia Tulipa, which is much about the ſame ſent.</p>

It riſeth out of the ground at the firſt, with one very long and ſmall round leafe, which when it is three or foure inches high, doth open it ſelfe, and ſhew forth another ſmall leafe (as long almoſt as the former) breaking out of the one ſide thereat, and after it a third, and ſometimes a fourth, and a fift; but each ſhorter then other, which afterwards be of the breadth of the dwarfe yellow Tulipa, or ſomewhat broader, but much longer then any other, and abiding more hollow, and of the colour of the early Tulipas on the inſide: the ſtalke riſeth vp a foot and a halfe <pb n="53" facs="tcp:15790:33"/>

It beareth faire broad leaues, reſembling the leaues of a Lilly, of a greeniſh colour, and not very whitiſh: the ſtalke beareth thereon one flower, larger and more open then many other, which is eyther wholly white, or of a deepe red colour, or elſe is variably mixed, white with a fine reddiſh purple, the bottomes being yellow, with purpliſh chiues tipt with blackiſh pendents: the roote is ſmall, and ſomewhat like the dwarfe yellow Tulipa, but ſomewhat bigger.</p>

                  <p>This ſmall Tulipa is much differing from all the former (except the ſmall or dwarfe white Tulipas remembred by Lobel and Cluſius, as is before ſet downe) in that it beareth three or foure ſmall, long, and ſomewhat narrow greene leaues, altogether at one ioynt or place; the ſtalke being not high, and naked or without leaues from them to the toppe, where it beareth one ſmall flower like vnto an ordinary red Tulipa, but ſomewhat more yellow, tending to an Orenge colour with a blacke bottome: the roote is not much bigger then the ordinary yellow Bolonia Tulipa, before ſet downe.</p>

A fourth, hath the leaues of the flower equally almoſt parted, with greene and a light purple colour, which abiding a long time in flower, groweth in time to be fairer marked: for at the firſt it doth not ſhew it ſelfe ſo plainely diuided.

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:15790:38"/>There yet remaine many obſeruations, concerning theſe beautifull flowers, fit to be knowne, which could not, without too much prolixity, be comprehended within the body of the deſcription of them; but are reſerued to bee intreated of a part by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                  <p>All ſorts of Tulipas beare vſually but one ſtalke, and that without any branches: but ſometimes nature is ſo plentifull in bearing, that it hath two or three ſtalkes, and ſometimes two, or more branches out of one ſtalke (euery ſtalke or branch bearing one flower at the toppe) but this is but ſeldome ſeene; and when it doth happen once, it is hardly ſeene againe in the ſame roote, but is a great ſigne, that the roote that doth thus, being an old roote, will the ſame yeare part into diuers rootes, whereof euery one, being of a reaſonable greatneſſe, will beare both his ſtalke and flower the next yeare, agreeing with the mother plant in colour, as all the of-ſets of Tulipas doe for the moſt part: for although the young of-ſets of ſome doe vary from the maine roote, euen while it groweth with them, yet being ſeparated, it will bee of the ſame colour with the mother plant.</p>
                  <p>There groweth oftentimes in the <hi>Medias,</hi> and ſometimes alſo in the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> but more ſeldome, a ſmall bulbe or roote, hard aboue the ground, at the bottome of the ſtalke, and betweene it and the lower leafe, which when the ſtalke is dry, and it ripe, being put into the ground, will bring forth in time a flower like vnto the mother plant, from whence it was taken.</p>
                  <p>The flowers alſo of Tulipas conſiſt moſt commonly of ſixe leaues, but ſometimes they are ſeene to haue eight or tenne, or more leaues; but vſually, thoſe rootes beare but their ordinary number of ſixe leaues the next yeare: the head for ſeede then, is for the moſt part foure ſquare, which at all other times is but three ſquare, or when the flower wanteth a leafe or two, as ſometimes alſo it doth, it then is flat, hauing but two ſides.</p>
                  <p>The forme of the flower is alſo very variable; for the leaues of ſome Tulipas are all ſharpe pointed, or all blunt and round pointed, and many haue the three outer leaues ſharpe pointed, and the three inner round or pointed, and ſome contrariwiſe, the three outermoſt round pointed, and the three inner ſharpe pointed. Againe, ſome haue all the leaues of the flowers long and narrow, and ſome haue them broader and ſhorter. Some <hi>Praecoces</hi> alſo haue their flowers very large and great, equall vnto eyther the <hi>Media,</hi> or <hi>Serotina,</hi> which moſt commonly are the largeſt, and others haue them as ſmall as the Bolonia Tulipa.</p>
                  <p>The bottomes of the leaues of the flowers are alſo variably diuerſified, and ſo are both the chiues or threeds that ſtand vp about the head, and the tips or pendents that are hanging looſe on the toppes of them; and by the difference of the bottomes or chiues, many flowers are diſtinguiſhed, which elſe are very like in colour, and alike alſo marked.</p>
                  <p>For the ſmell alſo there is ſome diuerſity; for that the flowers of ſome are very ſweete, of others nothing at all, and ſome betweene both, of a ſmall ſent, but not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue: and yet ſome I haue obſerued haue had a ſtrong ill ſent; but how to ſhew you to diſtinguiſh them, more then by your owne ſenſe, I cannot: for the ſeedes of ſweete ſmelling Tulipas doe not follow their mother plant, no more then they doe in the colour.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, take this, which is not the leaſt obſeruation, worth the noting, that I haue obſerued in many: When they haue beene of one entire colour for diuers yeares, yet in ſome yeare they haue altered very much, as if it had not beene the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> from a purple or ſtamell, it hath beene variably either parted, or mixed, or ſtriped with white, eyther in part, or through the whole flower, and ſo in a red or yellow flower, that it hath had eyther red or yellow edges, or yellow or red ſpots, lines, veines, or flames, running through the red or yellow colour, and ſometimes it hath happened, that three leaues haue been equally parted in the middle with red and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the other three abiding of one colour, and in ſome the red had ſome yellow in it, and the yellow ſome red ſpots in it alſo; whereof I haue obſerued, that all ſuch flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not hauing their originall in that manner, (for ſome that haue ſuch or the like markes from the beginning, that is, from the firſt and ſecond yeares flowring, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and doe not change) but as I ſaid, were of one colour at the firſt, doe ſhew the <pb n="63" facs="tcp:15790:38"/> weakneſſe and decay of the roote, and that this extraordinary beauty in the flower, is but as the brightneſſe of a light, vpon the very extinguiſhing thereof, and doth plainly declare, that it can doe his Maſter no more ſeruice, and therefore with this iollity doth bid him good night. I know there is a common opinion among many (and very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently maintained) that a Tulipa with a white flower, hath changed to beare a red or yellow, and ſo of the red or yellow, and other colours, that they are likewiſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as though no flowers were certaine: but I could neuer either ſee or heare for certaine any ſuch alteration, nor any other variation, but what is formerly expreſſed. Let not therefore any iudicious be carried away with any ſuch idle conceit, but rather ſuſpect ſome deceit in their Gardeners or others, by taking vp one, and putting in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the place, or elſe their owne miſtaking.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſowing, planting, tranſplanting, choiſe, and ordering of Tulipas, which is not the leaſt of regard, concerning this ſubiect in hand, but (as I think) would be willingly entertained; What I haue by my beſt endeauours learned, by mine owne paines in almoſt forty yeares trauell, or from others informations, I am willing here to ſet downe; not doubting, but that ſome may adde what hath not come to my knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the ſowing of ſeedes of Tulipas, I haue not obſerued (whatſoeuer others haue written) nor could of certainty learne of others, that there doth ariſe from the ſeedes of <hi>Praecoces</hi> any
<hi>Medias</hi> or <hi>Serotine</hi> Tulipas, (or but very ſeldome) nor am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly aſſured of any: but that the ſeedes of all <hi>Praecoces</hi> (ſo they be not doubtfull, or of the laſt flowring ſorts) will bring
<hi>Praecoces:</hi> And I am out of doubt, that I neuer ſaw, nor could learne, that euer the ſeede of the <hi>Medias</hi> or <hi>Serotines</hi> haue giuen <hi>Praecoces;</hi> but <hi>Medias</hi> or <hi>Serotines,</hi> according to their naturall kinde. But if there ſhould bee any degeneration, I rather incline to thinke, that it ſooner commeth to paſſe (<hi>à meliore ad peius,</hi> for <hi>facilis eſt deſcenſus,</hi> that is) that
<hi>Praecoces</hi> may giue <hi>Medias,</hi> then that <hi>Medias</hi> or
<hi>Serotines</hi> ſhould giue <hi>Praecoces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the choiſe of your ſeede to ſowe. Firſt, for the
<hi>Praecoces,</hi> Cluſius ſaith, that the <hi>Praecox Tulipa,</hi> that beareth a white flower, is the beſt to giue the greateſt variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Some among vs haue reported, that they haue found great variety riſe from the ſeede of the red <hi>Praecox,</hi> which I can more hardly beleeue: but Cluſius his experience hath the greater probability, but eſpecially if it haue ſome mixture of red or purple in it. The purple I haue found to be the beſt, next thereunto is the purple with white edges, and ſo likewiſe the red with yellow edges, each of them will bring moſt of their owne colours. Then the choiſe of the beſt <hi>Medias,</hi> is to take thoſe colours that are light, rather white then yellow, and purple then red; yea white, not yellow, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not red: but theſe againe to be ſpotted is the beſt, and the more the better; but withall, or aboue all in theſe, reſpect the ground or bottome of the flower, (which in the <hi>Praecox Tulipa</hi> cannot, becauſe you ſhall ſeldome ſee any other ground in them but yellow) for if the flower be white, or whitiſh, ſpotted, or edged, and ſtraked, and the bottome blew or purple (ſuch as is found in the Holias, and in the Cloth of ſiluer, this is beyond all other the moſt excellent, and out of queſtion the choiſeſt of an hundred, to haue the greateſt and moſt pleaſant variety and rarity. And ſo in degree, the meaner in beauty you ſowe, the leſſer ſhall your pleaſure in rarities be. Beſtowe not your time in ſowing red or yellow Tulipa ſeede, or the diuers mixtures of them; for they will (as I haue found by experience) ſeldome be worth your paines. The <hi>Serotina,</hi> or late flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Tulipa, becauſe it is ſeldome ſeene, with any eſpeciall beautifull variety, you may eaſily your ſelues gheſſe that it can bring forth (euen as I haue alſo learned) no raritie, and little or no diuerſity at all.</p>
                  <p>The time and manner to ſowe theſe ſeedes is next to be conſidered. You may not ſowe them in the ſpring of the yeare, if you hope to haue any good of them; but in the Autumne, or preſently after they be thorough ripe and dry: yet if you ſowe them not vntill the end of October, they will come forward neuer the worſe, but rather the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for it is often ſeene, that ouer early ſowing cauſeth them to ſpring out of the ground ouer early, ſo that if a ſharpe ſpring chance to follow, it may goe neere to ſpoile all, or the moſt of your ſeede. Wee vſually ſowe the ſame yeares ſeede, yet if you chance to keepe of your owne, or haue from others ſuch ſeed, as is two years old, they will thriue and doe well enough, eſpecially if they were ripe and well gathered: <pb n="64" facs="tcp:15790:39"/> You muſt not ſowe them too thicke, for ſo doing hath loſt many a pecke of good ſeede, as I can tell; for if the ſeede lye one vpon another, that it hath not roome vpon the ſprouting, to enter and take roote in the earth, it periſheth by and by. Some vſe to tread downe the ground, where they meane to ſowe their ſeede, and hauing ſowne them thereon, doe couer them ouer the thickneſſe of a mans thumbe with fine ſifted earth, and they thinke they doe well, and haue good reaſon for it: for conſidering the nature of the young Tulipa rootes, is to runne downe deeper into the ground, euery yeare more then other, they thinke to hinder their quicke deſcent by the faſtneſſe of the ground, that ſo they may encreaſe the better. This way may pleaſe ſome, but I doe not vſe it, nor can finde the reaſon ſufficient; for they doe not conſider, that the ſtiffeneſſe of the earth, doth cauſe the rootes of the young Tulipas to bee long before they grow great, in that a ſtiffe ground doth more hinder the well thriuing of the rootes, then a looſe doth, and although the rootes doe runne downe deeper in a looſe earth, yet they may eaſily by tranſplanting be holpen, and raiſed vp high enough. I haue alſo ſeene ſome Tulipas not once remoued from their ſowing to their flowring; but if you will not loſe them, you muſt take them vp while their leafe or ſtalke is freſh, and not withered: for if you doe not follow the ſtalke downe to the roote, be it neuer ſo deepe, you will leaue them behinde you. The ground alſo muſt be reſpected; for the finer, ſofter, and richer the mould is, wherein you ſowe your ſeede, the greater ſhall be your encreaſe and varietie: Sift it therefore from all ſtones and rubbiſh, and let it be either fat naturall ground of it ſelfe, or being muckt, that it bee thoroughly rotten: but ſome I know, to mend their ground, doe make ſuch a mixture of grounds, that they marre it in the making.</p>
                  <p>After the ſeede is thus ſowne, the firſt yeares ſpringing bringeth forth leaues, little bigger then the ordinary graſſe leaues; the ſecond yeare bigger, and ſo by degrees euery yeare bigger then other. The leaues of the <hi>Praecoces</hi> while they are young, may be diſcerned from the <hi>Medias</hi> by this note, which I haue obſerued. The leaues of them doe wholly ſtand vp aboue the ground, ſhewing the ſmall footſtalkes, whereby euerie leafe doth ſtand, but the leaues of the
<hi>Medias</hi> or <hi>Serotines</hi> doe neuer wholly appeare out of the ground, but the lower part which is broad, abideth vnder the vpper face of the earth. Thoſe Tulipas now growing to bee three yeares old, (yet ſome at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, if the ground and ayre be correſpondent) are to bee taken vp out of the ground, wherein yee ſhall finde they haue runne deepe, and to be anew planted, after they haue been a little dryed and cleanſed, eyther in the ſame, or another ground againe, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them reaſonable neare one vnto another, according to their greatneſſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted and couered ouer with earth againe, of about an inch or two thickneſſe, may be left vntaken vp againe for two yeare longer, if you will, or elſe remoued euery yeare after, as you pleaſe; and thus by tranſplanting them in their due ſeaſon (which is ſtill in the end of Iuly, or beginning of Auguſt, or thereabouts) you ſhall according to your ſeede and ſoyle, haue ſome come to bearing, in the fifth yeare after the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, (and ſome haue had them in the fourth, but that hath beene but few, and none of the beſt, or in a rich ground) ſome in the ſixth and ſeuenth, and ſome peraduenture, not vntill the eighth or tenth yeare: but ſtill remember, that as your rootes growe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that in re-planting you giue them the more roome to be diſtant one from another, or elſe the one will hinder, if not rot the other.</p>
                  <p>The ſeede of the <hi>Praecoces,</hi> doe not thriue and come forward ſo faſt as the <hi>Medias</hi> or <hi>Serotines,</hi> nor doe giue any of-ſets in their running downe as the <hi>Medias</hi> doe, which vſually leaue a ſmall roote at the head of the other that is runne downe euery yeare; and beſides, are more tender, and require more care and attendance then the <hi>Medias,</hi> and therefore they are the more reſpected.</p>
                  <p>This is a generall and certaine rule in all Tulipas, that all the while they beare but one leafe, they will not beare flower, whether they bee ſeedlings, or the of-ſets of elder rootes, or the rootes themſelues, that haue heretofore borne flowers; but when they ſhew a ſecond leafe, breaking out of the firſt, it is a certaine ſigne, that it will then beare a flower, vnleſſe ſome caſualty hinder it, as froſt or raine, to nip or ſpoile the bud, or other vntimely accident befall it.</p>
                  <p>To ſet or plant your beſt and bearing Tulipas ſomewhat deeper then other rootes, I hold it the beſt way; for if the ground bee either cold, or lye too open to the cold <pb n="65" facs="tcp:15790:39"/> Northerne ayre, they will be the better defended therein, and not ſuffer the froſts or cold to pierce them ſo ſoone: for the deepe froſts and ſnowes doe pinch the
<hi>Praecoces</hi> chiefly, if they bee too neare the vppermoſt cruſt of the earth; and therefore many, with good ſucceſſe, couer ouer their ground before Winter, with either freſh or old rotten dung, and that will maruellouſly preſerue them. The like courſe you may hold with ſeedlings, to cauſe them to come on the forwarder, ſo it bee after the firſt yeares ſowing, and not till then.</p>
                  <p>To remoue Tulipas after they haue ſhot forth their fibres or ſmall ſtrings, which grow vnder the great round rootes, (that is, from September vntill they bee in flower) is very dangerous; for by remouing them when they haue taken faſt hold in the ground, you doe both hinder them in the bearing out their flower, and beſides, put them in hazzard to periſh, at leaſt to bee put backe from bearing for a while after, as oftentimes I haue proued by experience: But when they are now riſen to flower, and ſo for any time after, you may ſafely take them vp if you will, and remoue them without danger, if you haue any good regard vnto them, vnleſſe it be a young bearing roote, which you ſhall in ſo doing much hinder, becauſe it is yet tender, by reaſon it now beareth his firſt flower. But all Tulipa roots when their ſtalke and leaues are dry, may moſt ſafely then be taken vp out of the ground, and be ſo kept (ſo that they lye in a dry, and not in a moiſt place) for ſixe moneths, without any great harme: yea I haue knowne them that haue had them nine moneths out of the ground, and haue done rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable well, but this you muſt vnderſtand withall, that they haue not been young but elder rootes, and they haue been orderly taken vp and preſerued. The dryer you keep a Tulipa roote the better, ſo as you let it not lye in the ſunne or winde, which will pierce it and ſpoile it.</p>
                  <p>Thus Gentlewomen for your delights, (for theſe pleaſures are the delights of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which hath bred your loue &amp; liking to them, and although you are herein predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, yet cannot they be barred from your beloued, who I doubt not, wil ſhare with you in the delight as much as is fit) haue I taken this paines, to ſet downe, and bring to your knowledge ſuch rules of art, as my ſmall skill hath enabled mee withall concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this ſubiect, which of all other, ſeemed fitteſt in this manner to be enlarged, both for the varietie of matter, and excellency of beautie herein, and alſo that theſe rules ſet forth together in one place, might ſaue many repetitions in other places, ſo that for the planting and ordering of all other bulbous rootes, and the ſowing the ſeedes of them, you may haue recourſe vnto theſe rules, <hi>(tanquam ad normam &amp; examen)</hi> which may ſerue in generall for all other, little diuerſitie of particulars needing exception.</p>

Camerarius in his Hortus Medicus is of opinion, it may be referred to the Helychryſum of Crateua. Geſner, as I thinke, firſt of all, and after him Lobel, Camerarius, Cluſius and many others, referre it to the Satyrium of Dioſcorides: and ſurely this opinion is the moſt probable for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Firſt, for that this plant doth grow very frequent in many places of Greece, and the leſſer Aſia, which were no doubt ſufficiently knowne both to Theophraſtus, and Dioſcorides, and was accounted among bulbous rootes, although by ſundry names. And ſecondly, as Dioſcorides ſetteth forth his Satyrium, ſo this moſt commonly beareth three leaues vpon a ſtalke (although ſometimes with vs it hath foure or fiue) like vnto a Lilly, whereof ſome are often ſeen to be both red, in the firſt ſpringing, and alſo vpon the decaying, eſpecially in a dry time, and in a dry ground: the flower likewiſe of ſome is white, and like a Lilly; the roote is round, and as white within as the white of an egge, couered with a browne coate, hauing a ſweetiſh, but not vnpleaſant taſte, as any man without danger many try. This deſcription doth ſo liuely ſet forth this plant, that I thinke wee ſhall not neede to be any longer in doubt, where to finde Dioſcorides his Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Triphyllum, ſeeing wee haue ſuch plenty growing with vs. And thirdly, there is no doubt, but that it hath the ſame qualities, as you ſhall hereafter heare further. And laſtly, that plant likewiſe that beareth a red flower, may very well agree with his Erythronium; for the deſcriptions in Dioſcorides are both alike, as are their qualities, the greateſt doubt may be in the ſeede, which yet may agree vnto Lin or Flaxe as fitly, or rather more then many other plants doe, in many of his compariſons, which yet wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue for currant. For the ſeede of Tulipas are flat, hard, and ſhining as the ſeede of <hi>Linum</hi> or Flaxe, although of another colour, and bigger, as Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorides himſelfe ſetteth it downe.

                  <p>THere hath beene great confuſion among many of our moderne Writers of plants, in not diſtinguiſhing the manifold varieties of Daffodils; for euery one almoſt, without conſideration of kinde or forme, or other ſpeciall note, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth names ſo diuerſly one from another, that if any one ſhall receiue from ſeuerall places the Catalogues of their names (as I haue had many) as they ſet them down, and compare the one Catalogue with the other, he ſhall ſcarce haue three names in a dozen to agree together, one calling that by one name, which another calleth by another, that very few can tell what they meane. And this their confuſion, in not diſtinguiſhing the name of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> from
<hi>Pſeudonarciſſus,</hi> is of all other in this kinde the greateſt and groſſeſt errour. To auoide therefore that gulfe, whereof I complaine that ſo manie haue bin endrenched; and to reduce the Daffodils into ſuch a methodicall order, that euery one may know, to what <hi>Claſsis</hi> or forme any one doth appertaine, I will firſt diuide them into two principall or primary kindes: that is, into <hi>Narciſſos,</hi> true Daffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dils, and
<hi>Pſeudonarciſſos,</hi> baſtard Daffodils: which diſtinction I hold to be moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to be ſet downe firſt of all that euery one may be named without confuſion vnder his owne primary kind, and then to let the other parts of the ſubdiuiſion follow, as is proper to them, and fitteſt to expreſſe them. Now to cauſe you to vnderſtand the difference betweene a true Daffodill and a falſe, is this; it conſiſteth onely in the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (when as in all other parts they cannot bee diſtinguiſhed) and chiefly in the middle cup or chalice; for that we doe in a manner onely account thoſe to bee <hi>Pſeudonarciſſos,</hi> baſtard Daffodils, whoſe middle cup is altogether as long, and ſometime a little longer then the outter leaues that doe encompaſſe it, ſo that it ſeemeth rather like a trunke or long noſe, then a cup or chalice, ſuch as almoſt all the <hi>Narciſsi,</hi> or true Daffodils haue; I ſay almoſt, becauſe I know that ſome of them haue their middle cup ſo ſmall, that we rather call it a crowne then a cup; and againe, ſome of them haue them ſo long, that they may ſeem to be of the number of the
<hi>Pſeudonarciſsi,</hi> or baſtard Daffodils: but yet may eaſily be knowne from them, in that, although the cup of ſome of the true Daffodils be great, yet it is wider open at the brim or edge, and not ſo long and narrow all alike as the baſtard kindes are, and this is the chiefe and onely way to know how to ſeuer theſe kindes, which rule holdeth certaine in all, except that kinde which is called <hi>Narcciſſus luncifolius reflexo flora,</hi> whoſe cup is narrow, and as long as the leaues that turne vp againe.</p>

It ſpringeth vp with one or two ſtalkes about a finger long, euery one bearing out of a ſmall huske one ſmall white flower, laid open abroad like vnto the Starre white Daffodill, before ſpoken of: in the middle of the flower is a ſmall yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low cup of a meane ſize, and after the flower is paſt, there commeth in the ſame place a ſmall head, containing ſmall, round, blacke ſeede, like vnto the Autumne Hyacinth: the leaues come vp after the ſeede is ripe and gone, being ſmall and narrow, not much bigger then the Autumne Hyacinth: the roote is ſmall and blackiſh on the outſide.</p>

                  <p>This baſtard Daffodill is ſo common in all England, both in Copſes, Woods, and Orchards, that I might well forbeare the deſcription thereof, and eſpecially, in that growing wilde, it is of little reſpect in our Garden: but yet, left I bee challenged of ignorance in common plants, and in regard of ſome variety therein worth the mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will ſet downe his deſcription and variety as briefly as I may: It hath three or foure grayiſh greene leaues, long and ſomewhat narrow, among which riſeth vp the ſtalke, about a ſpan high or little higher, bearing at the toppe, out of a skinnie huske, as all other Daffodils haue, one flower (although ſometimes I haue ſeene two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſomewhat large, hauing the ſix leaues that ſtand like wings, of a pale yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the long trunke in the middle of a faire yellow, with the edges or brimmes a little crumpled or vneuen: after the flower is paſt, it beareth a round head, ſeeming three ſquare, containing round blacke ſeede; the roote is ſomewhat blackiſh on the outſide.</p>

The rootes of all ſorts agree, and are alike, being white and very ſlimie; ſome whereof will be great and round, others long and ſlender, and thoſe that lye neare the toppe of the earth bare, will be greene.</p>

                     <p>The Squill or Sea Onion is wholly vſed phyſically with vs, becauſe wee can receiue no pleaſure from the ſight of the flowers. Pliny writeth, that Pithagoras wrote a volume or booke of the properties thereof, for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular effects it wrought; which booke is loſt, yet the diuers vertues it hath is recorded by others, to be effectuall for the ſpleene, lungs, ſtomach, liuer, head and heart; and for dropſies, old coughs, Iaundiſe, and the wormes; that it cleareth the ſight, helpeth the tooth-ache, cleanſeth the head of ſcurfe, and running ſores; and is an eſpeciall Antidote againſt poiſon: and therefore is vſed as a principall ingredient into the <hi>Theriaca Andromachi,</hi> which we vſually call Venice Treakle. The Apothecaries prepare hereof, both Wine, Vinegar, and Oxymel or Syrupe, which is ſingular to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and expectorate tough flegme, which is the cauſe of much diſquiet in the body, and an hinderer of concoction, or diſgeſtion in the ſtomach, beſides diuers other wayes, wherein the ſcales of the rootes, being dryed, are vſed.

The rootes of the common or vulgar, are (as Matthiolus ſaith) much eaten by poore people in Italy, either rawe or roaſted, being ſweeter in taſte then any Cheſnut, and ſeruing as well for a neceſſary food as for delight.

                  <p>It is common to all the Medowe Saffrons, except that of the Spring, and one other, to beare their flowers alone in Autumne or later, without any green leaues with them, and afterwards in February, their greene leaues: So that I ſhall not neede to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie deſcriptions, but to ſhew you the differences that conſiſt in the leaues, and colours of the flowers; and briefly to paſſe (after I haue giuen you a full deſcription of the firſt) from one vnto another, touching onely thoſe things that are note worthy. The white Engliſh Medowe Saffron then doth beare in Autumne three or foure flowers at the moſt, ſtanding ſeuerally vpon weake foote-ſtalkes, a fingers length or more aboue the ground, made of ſix white leaues, ſomewhat long and narrow, and not ſo large as moſt of the other kindes, with ſome threeds or chiues in the middle, like vnto the Saffron flowers of the Spring, wherein there is no colour of Saffron, or vertue to that effect: after the flowers are paſt and gone, the leaues doe not preſently follow, but the roote remaineth in the ground without ſhew of leafe aboue ground, moſt part of the Winter, and then in February there ſpring vp three or foure large and long greene <pb n="154" facs="tcp:15790:84"/> leaues, when they are fully growne vp, ſtanding on the toppe of a round, weake, green, and ſhort foote-ſtalke, ſomewhat like the leaues of white Lillies, but not ſo large, and in the middeſt of theſe leaues, after they haue been vp ſome time, appeare two or three looſe skinny heads, ſtanding in the middle of the leaues vpon ſhort, thicke, greene ſtalkes, and being ripe, conteine in them round ſmall browniſh ſeede, that lye as it were looſe therein, and when the head is dry, may bee heard to rattle being ſhaken: the roote is white within, but couered with a thicke blackiſh skinne or coate, hauing one ſide thereof at the bottome longer then the other, with an hollowneſſe alſo on the one ſide of that long eminence, where the flowers riſe from the bottome, and ſhooting downe from thence a number of white fibres, whereby it is faſtened in the ground: the greene leaues afterwards riſing from the top or head of the roote.</p>

<hi>Colchicum,</hi> whereunto ſome haue added <hi>Ephemerum,</hi> becauſe it killeth within one dayes ſpace; and ſome <hi>Strangulatorium.</hi> Some haue called them alſo <hi>Bulbus agreſtis,</hi> and <hi>Filius ante Patrem,</hi> The Sonne before the Father, becauſe (as they thinke) it giueth ſeede before the flower: but that is without due conſideration; for the root of this (as of moſt other bulbous plants) after the ſtalke of leaues and ſeede are dry, and paſt, may be tranſplanted, and then it beginneth to ſpring and giue flowers before leaues, (and therein onely it is differing from other plants) but the leaues and ſeede follow ſucceſſiuely after the flowers, before it may be remoued againe; ſo that here is not ſeede before flowers, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily flowers vpon the firſt planting or ſpringing, and ſeede after, as in all other plants, though in a diuers manner.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Colchicum Hermodactilum</hi> may ſeeme very likely to bee the <hi>Colchicum Orientale</hi> of Matthiolus, or the <hi>Colchicum Alexandrinum</hi> of Lobelius: And ſome thinke it to be the true

                  <p>I Can doe no otherwiſe then make a peculiar Chapter of this plant, becauſe it is neither a <hi>Crocus,</hi> although in the roote it come ſomewhat neare vnto that kinde that is netted; but in no other part agreeing with any the delineaments of a Saffron flower, and therefore could not be thruſt into the Chapter amongſt them: neither can I place it in the forefront of the Chapter of the <hi>Iris bulboſa,</hi> or bulbous Flowerdeluces, becauſe it doth not belong to that Family: and although the flower thereof doth moſt reſemble a Flowerdeluce, yet in that no other parts thereof doe fitly agree thereunto, I haue rather choſen to ſeate it by it ſelfe betweene them both, as partaking of both natures, and ſo may ſerue in ſtead of a bridge, to paſſe from the one to the other, that is, from the <hi>Crocus</hi> or Saffron flower, to the <hi>Iris bulboſa</hi> or bulbous rooted Flowerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce, which ſhall follow in the next Chapter by themſelues.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniſh Nut hath two long and narrow, ſoft and ſmooth greene leaues, lying for the moſt part vpon the ground, and ſometimes ſtanding vp, yet bending downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; betweene theſe leaues riſeth vp a ſmall ſtalke, halfe a foote high, hauing diuers ſmooth ſoft greene leaues vpon it, as if they were skinnes, through which the ſtalke paſſeth; at the toppe whereof ſtand diuers flowers, riſing one after another, and not all flowring at once: for ſeldome ſhall you haue aboue one flower blowne at a time, each whereof doth ſo quickly paſſe and fade away, that one may well ſay, that it is but one dayes flower, or rather the flower of a few houres: the flower it ſelfe hath nine leaues, like vnto a Flowerdeluce, whereof the three that fall downe, haue in each of them a yellow ſpot: the other three, which in the Flowerdeluces are hollow and ridged, couering the other three that fall downe, in this ſtand vpright, and are parted at the ends: the three that ſtand vp in the middle are ſmall and ſhort; the whole flower is ſmaller then any Flowerdeluce, but of ſundry colours; for ſome are of an excellent skie colour blew, others of a Violet purple, others of a darker purple colour, and ſome white, and many others mixed, either pale blew and deepe purple, or white and blew
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:15790:92"/> mixed or ſtriped together very variably, quickly fading as I ſaid before: the ſeede is encloſed in ſmall cods, ſo thinne and tranſparent, that one may eaſily ſee, and tell the ſeeds as they lye, which are of a browniſh red colour: the roote is ſmall, blackiſh and round, wrapped in a thicke skinne or huske, made like vnto a net, or ſomewhat like vnto the roote of the cloth of gold Crocus: when the plant is in flower, it is found to haue two rootes one aboue another, whereof the vppermoſt is firme and ſound, and the vndermoſt looſe and ſpongie, in like manner as is found in the rootes of diuers Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chides or Satyrions, Bee-flowers and the like, and without any good taſte, or ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at all, although Cluſius ſaith otherwiſe.</p>

<hi>Siſyrinchium</hi> or Spaniſh Nut, is without any taſte, and is not eaten. And againe, that there is not two kindes, although it grow greater, and with more flowers, in thoſe places that are neare the Sea, where both the waſhing of the Sea water, and the moiſture and ayre of the Sea, cauſeth the ground to bee more fertile. This I thought good, from the true relation of a friend, to giue the world to vnderſtand, that truth might expell errour.</p>

                     <p>The Sowebreads of the Spring doe both grow on the Pyrenaean Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in Italy, and in Candy, and about Mompelier in France; Antioch in Syria alſo hath yeelded ſome both of the Spring and Autumne. Thoſe with round and Iuie leaues grow in diuers places both of France and Italy: and the common in Germany, and the Lowe-Countries. But that Autumne Sowebread with white flowers, is reported to grow in the Kingdome of Naples. I haue very curiouſly enquired of many, if euer they found them in any parts of England, neare or farther off from the places where they dwell: but they haue all affirmed, that they neuer found, or euer heard of any that haue found of any of them. This onely they haue aſſured, that there groweth none in the places, where ſome haue reported them to grow.</p>

To diſtinguiſh the Family of

But to deſcribe the infinite (as I may ſo ſay) variety of the colours of the flowers, and to giue to each his true diſtinction and denomination, <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus eſt,</hi> it farre paſſeth my ability I confeſſe, and I thinke would grauell the beſt experienced this day in Europe (and the like I ſaid concerning Tulipas, it being as contingent to this plant, as is before ſaid of the Tulipa, to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end in yeelding varieties:) for who can ſee all the varieties that haue ſprung from the ſowing of the ſeede in all places, ſeeing the variety of colours riſen from thence, is according to the variety of ayres &amp; grounds wherein they are ſowne, skill alſo helping nature in ordering them aright. For the ſeede of one and the ſame plant ſowne in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ayres and grounds, doe produce that variety of colours that is much differing one from another; who then can diſplay all the mixtures of colours in them, to ſet them downe in ſo ſmall a roome as this Book?

                  <p>And thus much for the kindes of Anemones or Windflowers, ſo farre forth as haue hitherto come to our knowledge; yet I doubt not, but that more varieties haue beene elſewhere collected, and will be alſo in our Countrey daily and yearly obſerued by diuers, that raiſe them vp from ſowing the ſeede, wherein lyeth a pretty art, not yet fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly knowne to our Nation, although it be very frequent in the Lowe-Countries, where their induſtry hath bred and nouriſhed vp ſuch diuerſities and varieties, that they haue valued ſome Anemones at ſuch high rates, as moſt would wonder at, and none of our Nation would purchaſe, as I thinke. And I doubt not, if wee would be as curious as they, but that both our ayre and ſoyle would produce as great variety, as euer hath been ſeene in the Lowe-Countries; which to procure, if any of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will take ſo much paines in ſowing the ſeedes of Anemones, as diuers haue done of Tulipas: I will ſet them downe the beſt directions for that purpoſe that I haue learned, or could by much ſearch and tryall attaine vnto; yet I muſt let them vnderſtand thus much alſo, that there is not ſo great variety of double flowers raiſed from the ſeede of the thin leafed Anemones, as from the broad leafed ones.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore (as I ſaid before) concerning Tulipas, there is ſome ſpeciall choice to be made of ſuch flowers, whoſe ſeed is fitteſt to be taken. Of the <hi>Latifolias,</hi> the double Orenge tawney ſeede being ſowne, yeeldeth pretty varieties, but the purples, and reds, or crimſons, either <hi>Latifolias</hi> or <hi>Tenuifolias,</hi> yeeld ſmall variety, but ſuch as draw neareſt to their originall, although ſome be a little deeper or lighter then others. But the light colours be they which are the chiefe for choice, as white, aſh-colour, bluſh or carnation, light orenge, ſimple or party coloured, ſingle or double, if they beare ſeede, which muſt bee carefully gathered, and that not before it bee thorough ripe, which you ſhall know by the head; for when the ſeede with the wollineſſe beginneth to riſe a little of it ſelfe at the lower end, it muſt bee then quickly gathered, leſt the winde carry it all away. After it is thus carefully gathered, it muſt be laid to dry for a weeke or more, which then being gently rubbed with a little dry ſand or earth, will cauſe the ſeede to be ſomewhat better ſeparated, although not thoroughly from the woollineſſe or downe that compaſſeth it.</p>
                  <p>Within a moneth at the moſt after the ſeede is thus gathered and prepared, it muſt be ſowne; for by that meanes you ſhall gaine a yeare in the growing, ouer that you ſhould doe if you ſowed it in the next Spring.</p>
                  <p>If there remaine any woollineſſe in the ſeede, pull it in ſunder as well as you can, and then ſowe your ſeede reaſonable thin, and not too thicke, vpon a plaine ſmooth bed of fine earth, or rather in pots or tubbes, and after the ſowing, ſift or gently ſtraw ouer them ſome fine good freſh mould, about one fingers thickneſſe at the moſt for the firſt time: And about a moneth after their firſt ſpringing vp, ſift or ſtraw ouer them in like manner another fingers thickneſſe of fine earth, and in the meane time if the weather proue dry, you muſt water them gently and often, but not to ouerglut them with moiſture; and thus doing, you ſhall haue them ſpring vp before Winter, and <pb n="213" facs="tcp:15790:113"/> grow pretty ſtrong, able to abide the ſharpe Winter in their nonage, in vſing ſome little care to couer them looſely with ſome fearne, or furſe, or beane hame, or ſtraw, or any ſuch, which yet muſt not lye cloſe vpon them, nor too farre from them neither.</p>
                  <p>The next Spring after the ſowing, if you will, but it is better if you ſtay vntill Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, you may then remoue them, and ſet them in order by rowes, with ſufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one from another, where they may abide, vntill you ſee what manner of flower each plant will beare, which you may diſpoſe of according to your minde.</p>
                  <p>Many of them being thus ordered (if your mould be fine, looſe, and freſh, not ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, clayiſh, or from a middin) will beare flowers the ſecond yeare after the ſowing, and moſt or all of them the third yeare, if the place where you ſowe them, be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with the ſmoake of Brewers, Dyers, or Maultkils, which if it be, then will they neuer thriue well.</p>
                  <p>Thus much haue I thought good to ſet downe, to incite ſome of our owne Nation to be induſtrious; and to helpe them forward, haue giuen ſuch rules of directions, that I doubt not, but they will vpon the tryall and view of the variety, proceede as well in the ſowing of Anemones as of Tulipas.</p>
                  <p>I cannot (Gentlewomen) withhold one other ſecret from you, which is to informe you how you may ſo order Anemones, that after all others ordinarily are paſt, you may haue them in flower for two or three moneths longer then are to be ſeene with any other, that vſeth not this courſe I direct you.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary time to plant Anemones, is moſt commonly in Auguſt, which will beare flower ſome peraduenture before Winter, but moſt vſually in February, March, and Aprill, few or none of them abiding vntill May; but if you will keepe ſome roots out of the ground vnplanted, vntill February, March, and Aprill, and plant ſome at one time, and ſome at another, you ſhall haue them beare flower according to their planting, thoſe that ſhall be planted in February, will flower about the middle or end of May, and ſo the reſt accordingly after that manner: And thus may you haue the pleaſure of theſe plants out of their naturall ſeaſons, which is not permitted to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed in any other that I know, Nature being not ſo prone to bee furthered by art in other things as in this.

                  <p>HAuing long debated with my ſelfe, where to place this &amp; the other plants that follow in the two next Chapters, I haue thought it not amiſſe for this worke to ſet them downe here, both before the Beares eares, which are kindes of Sanicle, as the beſt Authors doe hold, and after the Cranes bils, both for ſome quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſomewhat reſembling them, and for ſome affinity of the flowers with the former.</p>
                  <p>The ſpotted Sanicle hath many ſmall round leaues, bluntly endented about the edges, ſomewhat like vnto the leaues of our white Saxifrage, of a full greene colour aboue, and whitiſh hairy, and ſomewhat reddiſh withall vnderneath: the ſtalkes are ſet here and there with the like leaues, riſing a foote and a halfe high or more, very much diuided at the toppe into ſundry ſmall branches, bearing many very ſmall white flowers, conſiſting of fiue ſmall leaues, wherein are many ſmall red ſpots to be ſeene, as ſmall as pins points, of a pretty ſweete ſent, almoſt like Hawthorne flowers, in the middle whereof are many ſmall threads compaſſing a head, which when it is ripe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ſmall blacke ſeede: the roote is ſcaly, or couered with a chaffie matter, hauing many ſmall white fibres vnderneath, whereby it is faſtened in the ground.</p>
                  <p>There is another of this kinde, like both in roote, leafe, and flower to the former,<note place="margin">Minor non gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tata.</note> the onely difference is, that this is leſſer then the former, and hath no ſpots in the flower, as the other hath.</p>
                  <p>We haue alſo another ſmaller kinde then the laſt, both in leafe and flower,<note place="margin">Minus guttata.</note> the leaues whereof are ſmaller, but rounder, and more finely ſnipt or indented about the edge, like the teeth of a fine ſawe: the ſtalke is little aboue a ſpan high, hauing many ſmall white flowers ſpotted as the firſt, but with fewer ſpots.</p>

<hi>Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica Alpina, Sanicula angustifolia,</hi> making a greater and a leſſer.

And ſome haue diſtinguiſhed them, by calling the Cowſlips, <hi>Primula veris Elatior,</hi> that is, the Taller Primroſe, and the other
<hi>Humilis,</hi> Lowe or Dwarfe Primroſes. In Engliſh they haue in like manner diuers names, according to ſeuerall Countries, as Primroſes, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlips, Oxelips, Palſiewort, and Petty Mulleins. The firſt kindes, which are lower then the reſt, are generally called by the name of Primroſes (as I thinke) throughout England. The other are diuerſly named; for in ſome Countries they call them Paigles, or Palſieworts, or Petty Mulleins, which are called Cowſlips in others. Thoſe are vſually called Oxelips, whoſe flowers are naked, or bare without huskes to containe them, being not ſo ſweete as the Cowſlip, yet haue they ſome little ſent, although the Latine name doth make them to haue none. The Franticke, Fantaſticke, or Fooliſh Cowſlip, in ſome places is called by Country people, Iacke an Apes on horſe-backe, which is an vſuall name with them, giuen to many other plants, as Daiſies, Marigolds, &amp;c. if they be ſtrange or fantaſticall, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the forme from the ordinary kinde of the ſingle ones.

                     <p>Our ordinary Borage by the conſent of all the beſt moderne Writers, is the true <hi>Bugloſſum</hi> of Dioſcorides, and that our Bugloſſe was vnknowne to the ancients.

Anchuſa hath diuers names, as Dioſcorides ſetteth downe. And ſome doe call it <hi>Fucus herba,</hi> from the Greeke word, becauſe the roote giuing ſo deepe a colour, was vſed to dye or paint the skinne. Others call it <hi>Bugloſſum Hiſpanicum,</hi> in Engliſh Alkanet, and of ſome Orchanet, after the French. Limonium was found by Leonhartus Rauwolfius, neere vnto Iop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, which he ſetteth downe in the ſecond Chapter of the third booke of his trauayles, and from him firſt knowne to theſe parts: I haue, as you ſee, referred it to the kindes of Bugloſſe, for that the flowers haue ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance vnto them, although I know that <hi>Limonium genuinum</hi> is referred to the Beetes. Let it therefore here finde a place of reſidence, vntill you or I can finde a fitter; and call it as you thinke beſt, eyther Limonium as Rau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfius doth, or Marſhe Bugloſſe as I doe, or if you can adde a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name, I ſhall not be offended.</p>

The variety of the colours of theſe flowers are very much, for ſome are wholly white, ſome of a blew or violet colour, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a bluſh or fleſh colour, or deepe or pale red, or of a dead purple, or dead mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey colour, as nature liſteth to ſhew it ſelfe.</p>

I account thoſe that are called Carnations to be the greateſt, both for leafe and flower, and Gilloflowers for the moſt part to bee leſſer in both; and therefore will giue you each deſcription apart, and the Orenge tawnie or yellow Gilloflower likewiſe by it ſelfe, as differing very notably from all the reſt.</p>

                  <p>The great Indian Tabacco hath many very large, long, thicke, fat and faire greene leaues, ſtanding foreright for the moſt part, and compaſſing the ſtalkes at the bottome of them, being ſomewhat pointed at the end: the ſtalke is greene and round, ſixe or ſeuen foote high at ſometimes, and in ſome places, in others not paſt three or foure foote high, diuided towards the toppe into many branches, with leaues at euery ioynt, and at the toppes of the branches many flowers, the bottomes hereof are long and hollow, and the toppes plaited or folded before they are open, but being open, are diuided ſometimes into foure, or more vſually into fiue corners, ſomewhat like vnto other of the Bell-flowers, but lying a little flatter open, of a light carnation colour. The ſeede is very ſmall and browne, contained in round heads, that are clammy while they are greene, and pointed at the end: the roote is great, whitiſh, and woody at the head, diſperſing many long branches, and ſmall fibres vnder the ground, whereby it is ſtrongly faſtened, but periſheth with our violent froſts in the winter, if it be left abroad in the garden, but if it be houſed, or ſafely prouided for againſt the froſtes, the rootes will liue, and ſpring afreſh the next yeare.</p>
                  <p>There is of this kinde another ſort, whoſe leaues are as large and long as the former, but thicker, and of a more dead greene colour, hanging downe to the ground-ward, and ſcarce any ſtanding forth-right, as the former, vnleſſe they bee very young: the flowers of this kinde are almoſt whole, without any great ſhew of corners at the brims or edges, in all other things there is no difference.</p>
                  <p>There is another, whoſe large and thicke flat leaues doe compaſſe the ſtalke at the bottome, and are as it were folded together one ſide vnto another: the flowers are of a deeper bluſh, or carnation colour, and with longer points and corners then in any of the former; and in theſe two things conſiſteth the difference from the others, and is called Verines Tabacco.</p>
                  <p>Another hath his leaues not ſo large and long as the firſt, and theſe haue ſhort foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalkes, whereon they ſtand, and doe not compaſſe the ſtalke as the other doe: the flower hereof is like the firſt, but ſmaller, and of a little paler colour.</p>

All theſe flowers doe open for the moſt part, in the euening, or in the night time, and ſo ſtand blowne open, vntill the next mornings ſun beginne to grow warme vpon them, which then cloſe themſelues together, all the brims of the flowers ſhrinking into the middle of the long necke, much like vnto the blew Bindeweede, which in a manner doth ſo cloſe vp at the ſunnes warme heate: or elſe if the day be temperate and milde, without any ſunne ſhining vpon them, the flowers will not cloſe vp for the moſt part of that day, or vntill toward night: after the flowers are paſt, come ſeuerall ſeedes, that is, but one at a place as the flowers ſtood before, of the bigneſſe (ſometimes) of ſmall peaſe, but not ſo round, ſtanding within the greene huskes, wherein the flowers ſtood before, being a little flat at the toppe, like a crowne or head, and round where it is faſtened in the cup, of a blacke colour when it is ripe, but elſe greene all the while it groweth on the ſtalke, and being ripe is ſoone ſhaken downe with the wind, or any other light ſhaking: the roote is long and round, greater at the head, and ſmaller downwards to the end, like vnto a Reddiſh, ſpreading into two or three, or more branches, blackiſh on the outſide and whitiſh within. Theſe rootes I haue often preſerued by art a winter, two or three (for they will periſh if they be left out in the garden, vnleſſe it be vnder a houſe ſide) becauſe many times, the yeare not falling out kindely, the plants giue not ripe ſeede, and ſo we ſhould be to ſeeke both of ſeede to ſow, and of rootes to ſet, if this or the like art to keep them, were not vſed; which is in this manner: Within a while after the firſt froſts haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the plants, that the leaues wither and fall, digge vp the rootes whole, and lay them in a dry place for three or foure dayes, that the ſuperfluous moyſture on the outſide, may be ſpent and dryed, which done, wrap them vp ſeuerally in two or three browne papers, and lay them by in a boxe, cheſt or tub, in ſome conuenient place of the houſe all the winter time, where no winde or moiſt ayre may come vnto them; and thus you ſhall haue theſe rootes to ſpring a freſh the next yeare, if you plant them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of March, as I haue ſufficiently tryed. But ſome haue tryed to put them vp into a barrell or firkin of ſand, or aſhes, which is alſo good if the ſand and aſhes be thorough dry, but if it bee any thing moiſt, or if they giue againe in the winter, as it is vſuall, they haue found the moiſture of the rootes, or of the ſand, or both, to putrefie the rootes, that they haue beene nothing worth, when they haue taken them forth. Take this note alſo for the ſowing of your ſeede, that if you would haue variable flowers, and not all of one colour, you muſt chooſe out ſuch flowers as be variable while they grow, that you may haue the ſeede of them: for if the flowers bee of one entire co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, you ſhall haue for the moſt part from thoſe ſeedes, plants that will bring flowers all of that colour, whether it be white, red or yellow.</p>

<hi>Flammila Matthioli,</hi> or <hi>Iouis cresta,</hi> as he there ſaith: but aſſuredly I haue beene informed from ſome of my eſpeciall friends beyond Sea, that they haue a double white <hi>Clematis,</hi> and haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſend it; but whether it will be of the climing or vpright ſort, I cannot tell vntill I ſee it: but ſurely I doe much doubt whether the double will giue any good ſeede.</p>

                     <p>The firſt is called of ſome <hi>Chamaelaea,</hi> with this addition <hi>Germanica,</hi> that it may differ from the third, which is the true <hi>Chamaelaea</hi> of Dioſcorides, as all the beſt Authors doe agree, and is alſo called <hi>Piper montanum</hi> of the Italians. It is generally called <hi>Mezereon,</hi> and is indeede the true <hi>Mezereon</hi> of the Arabians, and ſo vſed in our Apothecaries ſhops, whereſoeuer the Arabians <hi>Mezereon</hi> is appointed, although the Arabians are ſo intricate and vncertaine in the deſcriptions of their plants, confounding
<hi>Chamaelaea</hi> and <hi>Thymaelaea</hi> together. Matthiolus maketh it to be <hi>Daphnoides</hi> of Dioſcorides; but in my opinion he is therein miſtaken: for all our beſt moderne Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe account our
<hi>Laureola,</hi> which hath blacke berries, to bee the true
<hi>Daphnoides:</hi> the errour of his Countrey might peraduenture drawe him thereunto; but if hee had better conſidered the text of Dioſcorides, that giueth black berries to <hi>Daphnoides,</hi> and red to <hi>Chamaedaphne,</hi> he would not ſo haue written; and truly, I ſhould thinke (as Lobel doth) with better reaſon, that this <hi>Chamaelaea</hi> were Dioſcorides
<hi>Chamaedaphne,</hi> then hee to ſay it were <hi>Daphnoides:</hi> for the deſcription of <hi>Chamaedaphne,</hi> may in all parts be very fitly applyed to this <hi>Chamaelaea:</hi> and euen theſe words, <hi>Semen annexum folijs,</hi> wherein may be the greateſt doubt in the deſcription, may not vnfitly bee conſtrued, that as is ſeene in the plant, the berries growe at the foote of the leaues, about the branches: the faculties indeede that Dioſcorides giueth to <hi>Chamaedaphne,</hi> are (if any repugnancie be) the greateſt let or hinderance, that this <hi>Chamaelaea</hi> ſhould not be it: but I leaue the diſcuſſing of theſe and others of the like nature, to our learned Phyſitians; for I deale not ſo much with vertues as with deſcriptions. The ſecond is called of Lobel <hi>Chamaelaea Alpina incana,</hi> of Cluſius <hi>Chamaelaea ſecunda,</hi> and ſaith hee had it out of Italy. Wee may call it in Engliſh, Mountaine Spurge Oliue, as it is in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Mountaine Laurell, which you will. The laſt hath the name of <hi>Cneorum,</hi> firſt giuen it by Matthiolus, which ſince is continued by all others.

<hi>Lauroceraſus,</hi> The Cherry Bay; which may haue not onely ſome reſpect for his long buſh of ſweet ſmelling flowers, but eſpecially for the comely ſtatelineſſe of his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant euer freſh greene leaues; and the rather, becauſe with vs in moſt places, it doth but

                  <p>This wilde Baye groweth ſeldome to bee a tree of any height, but abideth for the moſt part low, ſhooting forth diuers ſlender branches, whereon at euery ioynt ſtand two leaues, long, ſmooth, and of a darke greene colour, ſomewhat like vnto the leaues of the Female Cornell tree, or between that and Baye leaues: at the toppes of the branches ſtand many ſmall white ſweete ſmelling flowers, thruſting together, as it were in an vmbell or tuft, conſiſting of fiue leaues a peece, the edges whereof haue a ſhew of a waſh purple, or light bluſh in them, which for the moſt part fall away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bearing any perfect ripe fruit in our Countrey: Yet ſometimes it hath ſmall black berries, as if they were good, but are not. In his naturall place it beareth ſmall, round, hard and pointed berries, of a ſhining blacke colour, for ſuch haue come often to my hands (yet Cluſius writeth they are blew); but I could neuer ſee any ſpring that I put into the ground.

                  <p>Of the Roſe Bay there are two ſorts, one bearing crimſon coloured flowers, which is more frequent, and the other white, which is more rare. They are ſo like in all other things, that they neede but one deſcription for both. The ſtemme or trunke is many times with vs as bigge at the bottome as a good mans thumbe, but growing vp ſmaller, it diuideth it ſelfe into branches, three for the moſt part comming from one ioynt or place, and thoſe branches againe doe likewiſe diuide themſelues into three other, and ſo by degrees from three to three, as long as it groweth: the loweſt of theſe are bare of leaues, hauing ſhed or loſt them by the cold of winters, keeping onely leaues on the vppermoſt branches, which are long, and ſomewhat narrow, like in forme vnto Peach leaues, but thicker, harder, and of a darke greene colour on the vpperſide, and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:15790:207"/> yellowiſh greene vnderneath: at the tops of the young branches come forth the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which in the one ſort before they are open, are of an excellent bright crimſon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and being blowen, conſiſt of foure long and narrow leaues, round pointed, ſomewhat twining themſelues, of a paler red colour, almoſt tending to bluſh, and in the other are white, the greene leaues alſo being of a little freſher colour: after the flowers are paſt, in the hot countries, but neuer in ours, there come vp long bending or crooked flat pods, whoſe outward ſhell is hard, almoſt woody, and of a browne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, wherein is contained ſmall flat browniſh ſeede, wrapped in a great deale of a browniſh yellow doune, as fine almoſt as ſilke, ſomewhat like vnto the huskes of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clepias,</hi> or

<hi>Pomeritron</hi> tree (which becauſe wee haue none in our Countrey, cannot be ſo well known) both for colour and largeneſſe, which yeeld a moſt gracefull aſpect: it beareth long ſtalkes of whitiſh flowers, at the ioynts of the leaues both along the branches and towards the ends of them alſo, like vnto the Birds Cherry or <hi>Padus Theophrasti,</hi> which the French men call <hi>Putier &amp; Ceriſier blanc,</hi> but larger and greater, conſiſting of fiue leaues with many threds in the middle: after which commeth the fruite or berries, as large or great as Flanders Cherries, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny growing together one by another on a long ſtalke, as the flowers did, which are very blacke and ſhining on the outſide, with a little point at the end, and reaſonable ſweete in taſte, wherein is contained a hard round ſtone, very like vnto a Cherry ſtone, as I haue obſerued as well by thoſe I receiued out of Italie, as by them I had of Maſter Iames Cole a Merchant of London lately deceaſed, which grew at his houſe in High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, where there is a faire tree which hee defended from the bitterneſſe of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in winter by caſting a blanket ouer the toppe thereof euery yeare, thereby the better to preſerue it.</p>

<hi>Rhododendros:</hi> in Engliſh The Roſe Bay, and Oleander. The laſt was ſent by the name of <hi>Trebezon Curmaſi,</hi> that is to ſay,
<hi>Dactylus Trape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuntina,</hi> but not hauing any affinitie with any kinde of Date, Bellonius as I thinke firſt named it <hi>Lauroceraſus,</hi> and
<hi>Ceraſus Trapezuntina.</hi> Dalechampius thinketh it to bee <hi>Lotus Aphricana,</hi> but Cluſius refuteth it. Thoſe ſtones or kernels that were ſent me out of Italie, came by the name of <hi>Laurus Regia,</hi> The Kings Bay. Wee may moſt properly call it according to the Latine name in the title, The Cherry bay, or Bay Cherry, becauſe his leaues are like vnto Bay-leaues, and both flowers and fruit like vnto the Birdes Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Cluſter Cherry, for the manner of the growing; and therfore I might more fitly I confeſſe haue placed it in my Orchard among the ſorts of Cherries: but the beautifulneſſe of the plant cauſed mee rather to inſert it here.</p>

                     <p>The wilde Bay hath no propertie allotted vnto it in Phyſicke, for that it is not to be endured, the berries being chewed declare it to be ſo violent hot and choking. The Roſe Bay is ſaid by Dioſcorides, to be death to all foure footed beaſts, but contrariwiſe to man it is a remedie againſt the poiſon of Serpents, but eſpecially if Rue bee added vnto it.

<hi>Syringa alba,</hi> that is in Engliſh, The white Pipe tree. Some would haue it to bee <hi>Oſtrys</hi> of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus, but Cluſius hath ſufficiently cleared that doubt.

<hi>Syringa Arabica flore albo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici,</hi> as moſt fitly agreeing thereunto. Of Baſilius Beſlerus that ſet forth the great booke of the Biſhop of Eyſtot in Germany his Garden, <hi>Syringa Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica flore albo pleno,</hi> becauſe, as it is likely, hee had it from Italy. It is very likely, that Proſper Alpinus in his booke of Egyptian plants, doth meane this plant, which hee there calleth <hi>Sambach, ſiue Iaſminum Arabicum.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeus Caccini of Florence in his letter to Cluſius entituleth it
<hi>Syringa Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bica, ſiue Iaſminum Arabicum, ſiue Iaſminum ex Gine,</hi> whereby hee declareth that it may not vnfitly be referred to either of them both. We may call it in Engliſh as it is in the title, The double white Pipe tree.</p>

                  <p>THe great varietie of Roſes is much to be admired, beeing more then is to bee ſeene in any other ſhrubby plant that I know, both for colour, forme and ſmell. I haue to furniſh this garden thirty ſorts at the leaſt, euery one notably diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the other, and all fit to be here entertained: for there are ſome other, that being wilde and of no beautie or ſmell, we forbeare, and leaue to their wilde habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To diſtinguiſh them by their colours, as white, red, incarnate, and yellow, were a way that many might take, but I hold it not ſo conuenient for diuers reſpects: for ſo I ſhould confound thoſe of diuers ſorts one among another, and I ſhould not keepe that methode which to me ſeemeth moſt conuenient, which is, to place and ranke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery kinde, whether ſingle or double, one next vnto the other, that ſo you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſtand their varieties and differences: I will therefore beginne with the moſt ancient, and knowne Roſes to our Countrey, whether naturall or no I know not, but aſſumed by our precedent Kings of all others, to bee cogniſances of their dignitie, the white Roſe and the red, whom ſhall follow the damaske, of the fineſt ſent, and moſt vſe of all the other ſorts, and the reſt in their order.</p>

                  <p>The white Roſe is of two kindes, the one more thicke and double then the other: The one riſeth vp in ſome ſhadowie places, vnto eight or ten foote high, with a ſtocke of a great bigneſſe for a Roſe. The other growing ſeldome higher then a Damaske Roſe. Some doe iudge both theſe to be but one kinde, the diuerſitie happening by the ayre, or ground, or both. Both theſe Roſes haue ſomewhat ſmaller and whiter greene leaues then in many other Roſes, fiue moſt vſually ſet on a ſtalke, and more white vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, as alſo a whiter greene barke, armed with ſharpe thornes or prickles, whereby they are ſoone known from other Roſes, although the one not ſo eaſily from the other: the flowers in the one are whitiſh, with an eye or ſhew of a bluſh, eſpecially towards the ground or bottome of the flower, very thicke double, and cloſe ſet together, and for the moſt part not opening it ſelfe ſo largely and fully as eyther the Red or Damaske Roſe. The other more white, leſſe thicke and double, and opening it ſelfe more, and ſome ſo little double as but of two or three rowes, that they might be held to be ſingle, yet all of little or no ſmell at all. To deſcribe you all the ſeuerall parts of the Roſe, as the bud, the beards, the threds &amp;c. were needleſſe, they are ſo conuerſant in euery ones hand, that I ſhall not neede but to touch the moſt ſpeciall parts of the varieties of them, and leaue a more exact relation of all things incident vnto them, vnto a generall worke.</p>

The Roſes or Flowers doe very much vary, according to their ſite and abiding; for ſome are of an orient, red or deepe crimſon colour, and very double (although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo double as the white) which when it is full blowne hath the largeſt leaues of any other Roſe; ſome of them againe are paler, tending ſomewhat to a damaske; and ſome are of ſo pale a red, as that it is rather of the colour of the canker Roſe, yet all for the moſt part with larger leaues then the damaske, and with many more yellow threds in the middle: the ſent hereof is much better then in the white, but not comparable to the excellencie of the damaske Roſe, yet this Roſe being well dryed and well kept, will hold both colour and ſent longer then the damaske, bee it neuer ſo well kept.</p>

The flowers are of a fine deepe bluſh colour, as all know, with ſome pale yellow threds in the middle, and are not ſo thicke and double as the white, nor being blowne, with ſo large and great leaues as the red, but of the moſt excellent ſweet pleaſant ſent, far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing all other Roſes or Flowers, being neyther heady nor too ſtrong, nor ſtuffing or vnpleaſant ſweet, as many other flowers.</p>

The leaues are likewiſe more reddiſh then in others, and ſomewhat larger, it vſually groweth very like the Damaske roſe, and much to the ſame height: the flowers or roſes are of the ſame deepe bluſh colour that the damaske roſes are, or rather ſomewhat deeper, but much thicker, broader, and more double, or fuller of leaues by three parts almoſt, the outer leaues turning themſelues backe, when the flower hath ſtood long blowne, the middle part it ſelfe (which in all other roſes almoſt haue ſome yellow threds in them to be ſeene) being folded hard with ſmall leaues, without any yellow almoſt at all to be ſeene, the ſent whereof commeth neereſt vnto the damaske roſe, but yet is ſhort of it by much, howſoeuer many doe thinke it as good as the damask, and to that end I haue known ſome Gentlewomen haue cauſed all their damaske ſtockes to bee grafted with prouince Roſes, hoping to haue as good water, and more ſtore of them then of damask Roſes; but in my opinion it is not of halfe ſo good a ſent as the water of damaske Roſes: let euery one follow their own fancie.</p>

Cluſius thinketh this large deſcription is but an ample deſcription of the third kinde of Poplar, called <hi>Lybica,</hi> the Aſpen tree, which Gaza tranſlateth
<hi>Alpina:</hi> but who ſo will well conſider it, ſhall finde it neyther anſwerable to any Poplar tree, in that it beareth not cods as <hi>Cercis</hi> doth; nor vnto this <hi>Arbor Iudae,</hi> becauſe it beareth not white branches. Cluſius ſaith alſo, that the learned of Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier in his time, referred it to <hi>Colytea</hi> of Theophraſtus in his third booke and ſeuenteenth chapter, where he doth liken it to the leaues of the broadeſt leafed Bay tree, but larger and rounder, green on the vpperſide, and whitiſh vnderneath, and whereunto (as he ſaith) Theophraſtus giueth cods in the fourteenth chapter of the ſame third booke: and by the contracting of their deſcriptions both together, ſaith, they agree vnto this Iudas tree.

<hi>Colutaea</hi> that Dioſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des mentioneth in the ſaid fourteenth chapter of his third booke, hath (as he ſaith there) a leafe like vnto the Willow, and therefore cannot bee the ſame <hi>Colutaea</hi> mentioned in the ſeuenteenth chapter of the ſame third book, which hath a broade Bay leafe: indeede hee giueth ſeede in cods: but that with broade Bay leaues is (as he ſaith) without eyther flower or fruite; and beſides all this, he ſaith the rootes are very yellow, which is not to bee found in this <hi>Arbor Iudae,</hi> or Iudas tree: let others now iudge if theſe things can bee well reconciled together. Some haue for the likeneſſe of the cods vnto Beane cods, called it <hi>Fabago.</hi> And Cluſius called it <hi>Siliqua ſilueſtris.</hi> It is generally in theſe dayes called <hi>Arbor Iudae,</hi> and in Engliſh after the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine name, vntill a fitter may be had, Iudas tree.</p>

But I ſhould rather thinke that the
<hi>Scorpioides</hi> were the truer <hi>Colutaea</hi> of Theophraſtus, becauſe the long pods thereof are more properly to bee accounted
<hi>ſiliquae,</hi> then the former which are <hi>veſicae tumentes,</hi> windy bladders, and not <hi>ſiliquae:</hi> and no doubt but Theophraſtus would haue giuen ſome peculiar note of difference if he had meant thoſe bladders, and not theſe cods. Let others of iudgement be vmpeeres in this caſe; although I know the currant of writers ſince Matthiolus, doe all hold the former <hi>Colutaea veficaria</hi> to be the true <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutaea Liparae</hi> of Theophraſtus. Wee call it in Engliſh, Baſtard Sena, from Ruellius, who as I thinke firſt called it Sena, from the forme of the leaues. The ſecond and third (as I ſaid before) from the forme of the cods receiued their names, as it is in the titles and deſcriptions; yet they may as properly be called <hi>Siliquoſae,</hi> for that their fruite are long cods.</p>

<hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> becauſe this agreeth with theirs in very many and notable parts; yet verily I thinke this plant is not the ſame, but rather another kinde of it ſelfe: Firſt, becauſe it is not <hi>frutex,</hi> a ſhrub or wooddy plant, nor keepeth his leaues all the yeare, but loſeth both leaues and ſtalks, dying down to the ground euery yeare: Secondly, the milke is not cauſticke or violent, as Alpinus and Bellus ſay
<hi>Oſſar</hi> is: Thirdly, the cods are more crooked then thoſe of Cluſius, or of Alpinus, which Honorius Bellus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth to be right, although greater then thoſe he had out of Egypt: And laſtly, the rootes of theſe doe runne, whereof none of them make any mention. Gerard in his Herball giueth a rude figure of the plant, but a very true figure of the cods with ſeede, and ſaith the Virginians call it <hi>Wiſanck,</hi> and referreth it to the <hi>Aſclepias,</hi> for the likeneſſe of the cods ſtuffed with <pb n="445" facs="tcp:15790:229"/> ſilken doune.

And becauſe it ſhould not want an Engliſh name anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſome peculiar property thereof, I haue from the ſilken doune called it Virginian Silke: but I know there is another plant growing in Virginia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called Silke Graſſe, which is much differing from this.</p>

This kinde of Sage groweth with branches and leaues, very like the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sage, but ſomewhat ſmaller, the chiefeſt difference conſiſteth in the colour of the leaues, being diuerſly marked and ſpotted with white and red among the greene: for vpon one branch you ſhall haue the leaues ſeuerally marked one from another, as the one halfe of the leafe white, and the other halfe greene, with red ſhadowed ouer them both, or more white then greene, with ſome red in it, either parted or ſhadowed, or daſht here and there, or more greene then white, and red therein, eyther in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or end of the leafe, or more or leſſe parted or ſtriped with white and red in the greene, or elſe ſometimes wholly greene the whole branch together, as nature liſteth to play with ſuch varieties: which manner of growing riſing from one and the ſame plant, becauſe it is the more variable, is the more delightfull and much reſpected.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſpeckled Sage parted with white and greene, but it is nothing of that beauty to this, becauſe this hath three colours euidently to bee diſcerned in euery leafe almoſt, the red adding a ſuperaboundant grace to the reſt.</p>

                  <p>The ſweet Marierome that is moſt ftequently ſowen in our Country, is a low herbe little aboue a foote high when it is at the higheſt, full of branches, and ſmall whitiſh ſoft roundiſh leaues, ſmelling very ſweet: at the toppes of the branches ſtand diuers ſmall ſcaly heads, like vnto knots, (and therefore of ſome called knotted Marierome) of a whitiſh greene colour, out of which come here and there ſmall white flowers, and afterwards ſmall reddiſh ſeede: the roote is compoſed of many ſmall threds or ſtrings, which periſh with the whole plant euery yeare.</p>

                  <p>This Marierome hath likewiſe diuers ſmall branches, growing low, and not higher then the former, but hauing finer and ſmaller leaues, hoary and ſoft, but much ſweeter: the heads are like vnto the former, and ſo are the flowers and ſeede, and the whole plant abiding but a Summer in the like manner.</p>

                  <p>The neerer reſemblance that this herbe hath with Marierome then with Tyme (as I ſaid before) hath made me place it next vnto the ſmall ſweet Marierome. It riſeth vp with a greater, and a more woody ſtalke then Marierome, two foote high or better in ſome places, where it liketh the ground and ayre, branching out on all ſides towards the vpper part, leauing the ſtemme bare below, if it bee old, otherwiſe being young, thinly furniſhing the branches from the bottome with ſmall greene leaues, bigger then the leaues of any Tyme, and comming neere vnto the bigneſſe and forme of the laſt recited finer Marierome, but of a greener colour: at the toppes of the branches ſtand ſmall white flowers on a head, which afterwards turne into a looſe tuft of a long white hoary matter, like vnto ſoft doune, with ſome leaues vnderneath and about it, which abide not long on the ſtalkes, but are blowne away with the winde: the ſeede is ſo ſmall if it haue any, that I haue not obſerued it: the roote is threddy: the whole plant is of a ſweete reſinous ſent, ſtronger then the Marierome, and abideth our winters, if it be carefully planted and regarded.</p>

The firſt is vſually ſowen euery yeare in moſt gardens with vs: but the ſecond is very rare and daintie, and muſt as daintely be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, being more tender then the former.

                     <p>The firſt of the two ſweet Marieromes called
<hi>Maiorana</hi> in Latine <hi>à maiore cura,</hi> is taken of moſt writers to be the <hi>Amaracus</hi> or <hi>Sampſuchum</hi> of Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides, Theophraſtus and Plinie, although Galen doth ſeem a little to diſſent therefrom. The other ſweet Marierome hath his name in his title as much as can be ſaid of it. The next is thought by the beſt of the moderne Writers to be the true <hi>Marum</hi> that Galen preferreth for the excellent ſweetneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former Marierome in making the <hi>Oleum,</hi> or
<hi>vnguentum Amaricinum,</hi> and ſeemeth to incline to their opinion that thought <hi>Amaracus</hi> was deriued from <hi>Marum.</hi> It is the ſame alſo that Galen and others of the ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters make mention of, to go into the compoſition of the <hi>Trochiſci Hedychroi,</hi> as well as
<hi>Amaracus</hi> among the ingredients of the <hi>Theriaca Andromachi.</hi> In Engliſh we call it Maſticke ſimply, or Herbe Maſtick, both to diſtinguiſh it from that Tyme that is called Maſticke Tyme, and from the Maſticke Tree, or Gum, ſo called. Some of later times, and Cluſius with them, haue thought this to be Dioſcorides his <hi>Tragoriganum,</hi> which doth ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it: but there is another plant that Matthiolus ſetteth forth for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> that in Lobels opinion and mine is the trueſt <hi>Tragoriganum,</hi> and this the trueſt <hi>Marum.</hi>

                  <p>THere are many kindes of Tyme, as they are vſually called with vs, ſome are called of the garden, and others wilde, which yet for their ſweetneſſe are brought into gardens, as Muske Tyme, and Lemon Tyme; and ſome for their beauty, as embroidered or gold yellow Tyme, and white Tyme. But the true Tyme of the ancient Writers, called <hi>Capitatum,</hi> as a ſpeciall note of diſtinction from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindes of Tyme, is very rare to be ſeene with vs here in England, by reaſon of the tenderneſſe, that it will not abide our Winters. And all the other ſorts that with vs are called garden Tymes, are indeede but kindes of wilde Tyme, although in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or want of the true Tyme, they are vſed in the ſtead of it. With the Tymes I muſt doe as I did with the Marieromes in the Chapter before, that is, reſerue the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in vſe, for the common vſe of the Kitchen, and ſhew you only thoſe here, that are not put to that vſe: and firſt with the true Tyme, becauſe it is knowne but to a few.</p>

                  <p>The true Tyme is a very tender plant, hauing hard and hoary brittle branches, ſpreading from a ſmall wooddy ſtemme, about a foote and a halfe high, whereon are ſet at ſeuerall ioynts, and by ſpaces, many ſmall, long, whitiſh, or hoary greene leaues, of a quicke ſent and taſte: at the tops of the branches ſtand ſmall long whitiſh greene heads, ſomewhat like vnto the heads of <hi>Stoechas,</hi> made as it were of many leaues or ſcales, out of which ſtart forth ſmall purpliſh flowers (and in ſome white, as Bellonius ſaith) after which commeth ſmall ſeede, that ſoone falleth out, and if it be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gathered, is ſoone loſt, which made (I thinke) Theophraſtus to write, that this Tyme was to be ſowne of the flowers, as not hauing any other ſeede: the root is ſmall and wooddy. This holdeth not his leaues in Winter, no not about Seuill in Spaine, where it groweth aboundantly, as Cluſius recordeth, finding it there naked or ſpoiled of leaues. And will not abide our Winters, but periſheth wholly, roote and all.</p>

It is vſed of many people in the Country, to be laid vnto cuts or freſh wounds, being bruiſed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed eyther alone, or with a little Sugar. It is much vſed as a ſweet herbe, to be in the windowes of an houſe. I finde it much commended againſt the Falling Sickneſſe, eſpecially being made into Pils after this manner: Of Hyſſope, Horhound, and Caſtor, of each halfe a dramme, of Peony rootes (the male kinde is onely fit to be vſed for this purpoſe) two drams, of <hi>Aſſa faetida</hi> one ſcruple: Let them be beaten, and made into pils with the iuyce of Hyſſope; which being taken for ſeuen dayes together at night going to bed, is held to be effectual to giue much eaſe, if not thoroughly to cure thoſe that are troubled with that diſeaſe. The vſe of Germander ordinarily is as Tyme, Hyſſope, and other ſuch herbes, to border a knot, whereunto it is often appropriate, and the rather, that it might be cut to ſerue (as I ſaid) for a ſtrewing herbe for the houſe among others.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing giuen you the beſt rules and inſtructions that I can for your flower Garden, and all the flowers that are fit to furniſh it, I now proceede to your herbe garden, which is not of the leaſt reſpect belonging to any mans houſe, nor vtterly to bee neglected for the many vtilities are to be had from it, both for the Maſters profit and pleaſure, and the meynies content and nouriſhment: all which if I ſhould here ſet down, I had a large field to wander in, and matter ſufficient to entreat of, but this worke permitteth not that libertie: and I thinke there are but few but eyther know it already, or conceiue it ſufficiently in their minds. Paſſing therefore no further in ſuch diſcourſes, I come to the matter in hand, which is to ſhew you where the fitteſt place is for an herbe garden. As before I ſhewed you that the beautie of any worthy houſe is much the more commended for the pleaſant ſituation of the garden of flowers, or of pleaſure, to be in the ſight and full proſpect of all the chiefe and choiſeſt roomes of the houſe; ſo contrariwiſe, your herbe garden ſhould bee on the one or other ſide of the houſe, and thoſe beſt and choyſe roomes: for the many different ſents that ariſe from the herbes, as Cabbages, Onions, &amp;c. are ſcarce well pleaſing to perfume the lodgings of any houſe; and the many ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and breaches as it were of many of the beds thereof, which muſt neceſſarily bee, are alſo as little pleaſant to the ſight. But for priuate mens houſes, who muſt like their habitations as they fall vnto them, and cannot haue time or meanes to alter them, they muſt make a vertue of neceſſity, and conuert their places to their beſt aduantage, by making their profit their chiefeſt pleaſure, and making one place ſerue for all vſes. The choyce of ground for this Garden, is (as I ſaid before) where it is fat, fertill and good, there needeth the leſſe labour and coſt: and contrariwiſe, where it is cold, wet, dry or barren, there muſt bee the more helpes ſtill added to keepe it in heart. For this Garden by reaſon of the much and continuall ſtirring therein, the herbes and rootes drawing out the ſubſtance of the fertilitie thereof more aboundantly then in the former, muſt be continually holpen with ſoyle, or elſe few things of goodneſſe or worth will come forward therein. The ſtable ſoyle of horſes is beſt and more proper for any colde grounds, for being the hotteſt, it will cauſe any the ſeedes for this Garden to proſper well, and be more forward then in any other ground that is not ſo holpen. The ſtable ſoyle of Cattell is of a colder and moiſter nature, and is therefore more proper for <pb n="462" facs="tcp:15790:238"/> the hot ſandy or grauelly grounds, and although it bee longer before it bee brought to mould then that of horſes, yet it will outlaſt it more then twice ſo long. Let euery one therefore take according to the nature of the ground ſuch helpes as are moſt fit and conuenient, as I haue here and before ſhewed. But I doe here ingenuouſly confeſſe my opinion of theſe forcings and helpings of ground, that howſoeuer it doth much good to ſome particular things, which becauſe they delight in heate, and cannot be brought to perfection without it in this our Countrey, which is colder then their naturall from whence they are brought, muſt therfore haue artificiall helpes to forward them; yet for many other things the compoſt doth much alter and abate the naturall vigour, and quickeneſſe of taſte, that is perceiued in them that grow in a naturall fat or ſandy ſoile that is not ſo holpen.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The forme of a Garden of herbes for neceſſary vſes, with the ordering thereof.</head>
               <p>AS our former Garden of pleaſure is wholly formable in euery part with ſquares, trayles, and knots, and to bee ſtill maintained in their due forme and beautie: ſo on the contrary ſide this Garden cannot long conſerue any forme, for that euery part thereof is ſubiect to mutation and alteration. For although it is conuenient that many herbes doe grow by themſelues on beds, caſt out into ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion fit for them, as Tyme, Hiſſope, Sage, &amp;c. yet many others may bee ſowen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on a plot of ground of that largeneſſe that may ſerue euery mans particular vſe as he ſhall haue occaſion to employ it, as Reddiſh, Lettice and Onions, which after they are growne vp together may be drawne vp and taken away, as there is occaſion to ſpend them: but Carrots or Parſneps being ſowen with others muſt bee ſuffered to grow laſt, becauſe they require a longer time before they be fit to be taken vp. Other herbes require ſome large compaſſe of ground whereon they may grow of themſelues without any other herbes growing among them, as Artichokes, Cowcumbers, Melons, Pompions. And ſome will doe ſo with their Cabbages alſo, but the beſt and moſt fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall way now vſed, is to plant them round about the border of your plot or ground whereon you plant Cowcumbers, Pompions, or other things, in that by this meanes ſo much ground will be well ſaued, and the other things be no whit hindered thereby, which elſe a great deale of ground muſt be employed for them apart. So that by this that I haue here ſaid, you may perceiue the forme of this Garden is for the moſt part, to bee ſtill out of forme and order, in that the continuall taking vp of the herbes and rootes that are ſowen and planted, cauſeth the beds or parts of this Garden to lye broken, diſmembered, and out of the order that at the firſt it was put into. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber herewithall that (as I ſaid before) this Garden requireth the continuall helpe of ſoyle to be brought into it, in that the plenty of theſe manner of herbes and rootes doe ſo much waſte the fertilitie and fatneſſe of the ground, that without continuall refreſhing it would quickly become ſo poore and barren, that it would not yeelde the worth of the ſeede. The ordinary time to ſoyle a Garden, is to bring in manure or dung before Chriſtmas, and eyther bury it ſome ſmall depth, not too deepe, or elſe to lay it vpon the ground that the winter froſtes may pierce it, and then turne it ſhallow into the ground to ſow your ſeeds in the Spring.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> How to order diuers Garden herbes, both for their ſowing, ſpending, and gathering of the ſeede.</head>
               <p>OVr chiefeſt and greateſt Gardiners now adaies, doe ſo prouide for themſelues euery yeare, that from their owne grounds they gather the ſeede of many herbes that they ſowe againe: for hauing gained the beſt kind of diuers herbes, they will be ſtill furniſhed with the ſame, and be not to ſeeke euery yeare for new that oftentimes will not yeelde them halfe the profit that their choyce ſeede will: I ſay of many herbes, but not of all; for the beſt of them all hath not ground ſufficient for all ſorts, nor will our climate bring ſome to that perfection that other forraine doth, and therefore the ſeede of ſome things are continually brought from beyond Sea vnto vs. And againe although our chiefe Gardiners doe ſtill prouide their owne ſeede of diuers things from their owne ground, becauſe as I ſaid it is of the beſt kinde, yet you muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand alſo, that good ſtore of the ſame ſortes of ſeeds are brought from beyond the Seas, for that which is gathered in this Land is not ſufficient to ſerue euery mans vſe in the whole Kingdome by many parts; yet ſtill it is true, that our Engliſh ſeede of many things is better then any that commeth from beyond the Seas: as for example, Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, Lettice, Carrots, Parſneps, Turneps, Cabbages, and Leekes, of all which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to write in this place; for theſe are by them ſo husbanded, that they doe not ſow their owne grounds with any other ſeede of theſe ſorts but their owne: which that you may know the manner how to doe, I will here ſet it downe, that euery one may haue the beſt directions if they will follow them. Of Reddiſh there are two ſorts, one more early then the other: they vſe therfore to ſow their early Reddiſh firſt, that they may haue the earlieſt profit of them, which is more worth in one fortnight, then in a moneth after. And to effect this they haue ſome artificiall helps alſo; which are theſe: They vſe to digge vp a large plot of ground where they intend to ſow their ſeede a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before or after Chriſtmas, caſting it into high balkes or ridges fiue or ſixe foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, which they ſuffer to lye and take all the extreame froſts in Ianuary to mellow the earth, and when the froſtes are paſt, they then beginne to bring into it good ſtore of freſh ſtable dung, which they laye neyther too deepe nor too thicke, and couer it with the mould a hand breadth thickneſſe aboue the dung, which doth giue ſuch a warmth and comfort to whatſoeuer is ſowen thereon, that it forceth it forward much ſooner then any other way can doe: And to preuent both the froſtes, and the cold bitter windes which often ſpoyle their ſeede new ſprung vp, they vſe to ſet great high and large mattes made of reedes, tyed together, and faſtened vnto ſtrong ſtakes, thruſt into the ground to keepe them vp from falling, or being blowne down with the winde; which mattes they place on the North and Eaſt ſide to breake the force of theſe winds, and are ſo ſure and ſafe a defence, that a bricke wall cannot better defend any thing vnder it, then this fence will. In this manner they doe euery yeare to bring forward their ſeede to gaine the more by them, and they that will haue Reddiſh early, muſt take the ſame courſe. The other ſort of Reddiſh for the moſt part is ſowen in Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, a fortnight after the other at the leaſt, and likewiſe euery moneth after vnto Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, that they may haue young continually. For the blacke Reddiſh, although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in many places doe ſowe it in the ſame time, and in the ſame manner that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is ſowen, yet the nature thereof is to runne vp to ſeede more ſpeedily then the other, if it haue ſo rich ground to grow vpon, and therefore the beſt time to ſow it is in Auguſt, that ſo it may abide all winter, wherein is the chiefeſt time for the ſpending thereof, and to keepe it vntill the beginning of the next yeare from running vp to ſeede the gathering whereof, as alſo of the other ſort, is all after one manner, that is, to be pulled vp when the pods change whitiſh, and then hanged vpon buſhes, pales, or ſuch other thing, vntill they bee thorough dry, and then beaten or thraſhed out vpon a ſmooth plancher, or vpon clothes, as euery ones ſtore is, and their conueniencie. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is ſowen oftentimes with the early Reddiſh, in the ſame manner before ſaid, that they may haue Lettice likewiſe as early as the time of the year will permit them, which <pb n="464" facs="tcp:15790:239"/> they pull vp where they grow too thicke, ſpending them firſt, and ſo taking, vp from time to time, vntill they ſtand two foote in ſunder one from another, and beginne to ſpindle and ſhoote vp for ſeede. In this is vſed ſome arte to make the plants ſtrong to giue the better ſeede without danger of rotting or ſpoyling with the wet, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happeneth to thoſe about whom this caution is not obſerued: Before your Lettice is ſhot vp, marke out the choyſeſt and ſtrongeſt plantes which are fitteſt to grow for ſeede, and from thoſe when they are a foote high, ſtrippe away with your hand the leaues that grow loweſt vpon the ſtalke next the ground, which might rot, ſpoyle or hinder them from bearing ſo good ſeede; which when it is neere to be ripe, the ſtalkes muſt be cut off about the middle, and layde vpon mats or clothes in the Sunne, that it may there fully ripen and be gathered; for it would be blowne away with the winde if it ſhould be ſuffered to abide on the ſtalkes long. Parſneps muſt be ſowen on a deep trenched mellow ground, otherwiſe they may run to ſeede the firſt yeare, which then are nothing worth: or elſe the rootes will be ſmall ſtaruelings and ſhort, and runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many ſpires or branches, whereby they will not bee of halfe the worth. Some vſe to ſow them in Auguſt and September, that ſo they may bee well growne to ſerue to ſpend in Lent following, but their beſt time is in February, that the Summers growth may make them the fairer and greater. When they runne vp to ſeede, you ſhall take the principall or middle heades, for thoſe carry the Maſter ſeede, which is the beſt, and will produce the faireſt rootes againe. You ſhall hardly haue all the ſeede ripe at one inſtant, for vſually the chiefeſt heads will be fallen before the other are ripe: you muſt therefore ſtill looke them ouer, and cut them as they ripen. Carrots are vſually ſowen in March and Aprill, and if it chance that ſome of them doe runne vp for ſeede the ſame year, they are to be weeded out, for neyther the ſeed nor roots of them are good: You muſt likewiſe pull them vp when they are too thicke, if you will haue them grow fair, or for ſeed, that they may grow at the leaſt three or foure foot in ſunder: the ſtalkes of Carrots are limber, and fall downe to the ground; they muſt therefore be ſuſtained by poles layde acroſſe on ſtalkes thruſt into the ground, and tyed to the poles and ſtalkes to keepe them vp from rotting or ſpoyling vpon the ground: the ſeed hereof is not all ripe at once, but muſt be tended and gathered as it ripeneth, and layd to dry in ſome dry chamber or floore, and then beaten out with a ſtick, and winnowed from the refuſe. Turneps are ſowne by themſelues vpon a good ground in the end of Iuly, and beginning of Auguſt, to haue their rootes beſt to ſpend in winter; for it often happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that thoſe ſeedes of Turneps that are ſowen in the Spring, runne vp to ſeede the ſame yeare, and then it is not accounted good. Many doe vſe to ſow Turneps on thoſe grounds from whence the ſame yeare they haue taken off Reddiſh and Lettice, to make the greater profit of the ground, by hauing two crops of increaſe in one yeare. The ſtalkes of Turneps will bend downe to the ground, as Carrots doe, but yet muſt not be bound or ordered in that manner, but ſuffered to grow without ſtaking or binding, ſo as they grow of ſome good diſtance in ſunder: when the ſeede beginneth to grow ripe, be very carefull to preſerue it from the birds, which will be moſt buſie to deuour them. You ſhall vnderſtand likewiſe that many doe account the beſt way to haue the faireſt and moſt principall ſeede from all theſe fore-recited herbes, that after they are ſowen, and riſen to a reaſonable growth, they be tranſplanted into freſh ground. Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages alſo are not only ſowen for the vſe of their heads to ſpend for meat, but to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ſeede likewiſe, which howſoeuer ſome haue endeauoured to doe, yet few haue gained good ſeede, becauſe our ſharpe hard froſtes in winter haue ſpoyled and rotted their ſtockes they preſerued for the purpoſe; but others haue found out a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a more ſure way, which is, to take vp your ſtocks that are fitteſt to be preſerued, and bring them into the houſe, and there wrap them eyther in clothes, or other things to defend them from the cold, and hang them vp in a dry place, vntill the beginning of March following, then planting them in the ground, and a little defend them at the firſt with ſtraw caſt ouer them from the cold nights, thereby you may be ſure to haue perfect good ſeede, if your kinde be of the beſt: Sowe your ſeed in the moneths of February or March, and tranſplant them in May where they may ſtand to grow for your vſe, but be carefull to kill the wormes or Caterpillers that elſe will deuoure all your leaues, and be carefull alſo that none of the leaues bee broken in the planting, or otherwiſe rubbed, for that oftentimes hindereth the well cloſing of them. Leekes are
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:15790:239"/> for the moſt part wholly nourſed vp from the ſeede that is here gathered; and becauſe there is not ſo much ſtore of them either ſowne or ſpent, as there is of Onions by the twentieth part, we are ſtill the more carefull to be prouided from our owne labours; yet there be diuers Gardiners in this Kingdome, that doe gather ſome ſmall quantity of Onion ſeede alſo for their owne or their priuate friends ſpending. The ſowing of them both is much about one time and manner, yet moſt vſually Leeks are ſowne later then Onions, and both before the end of March at the furtheſt; yet ſome ſowe Onions from the end of Iuly to the beginning of September, for their Winter prouiſion. Thoſe that are ſowne in the Spring, are to be taken vp and tranſplanted on a freſh bed prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the purpoſe, or elſe they will hardly abide a Winter; but hauing taken roote before Winter, they will beare good ſeede in the Summer following: You muſt ſtake both your Leekes and your Onion beds, and with poles laid a croſſe, binde your lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple headed ſtalkes vnto them, on high as well as belowe, or elſe the winde and their owne weight will beare them downe to the ground, and ſpoile your ſeede. You muſt thinne them, that is, pull vp continually after they are firſt ſprung vp thoſe that growe too thicke, as you doe with all the other herbes before ſpoken of, that they may haue the more roome to thriue. Of all theſe herbes and rootes before ſpoken of, you muſt take the likelieſt and faireſt to keepe for your ſeede; for if you ſhould not take the beſt, what hope of good ſeede can you expect? The time for the ſpending of theſe herbes and rootes, not particularly mentioned, is vntill they begin to runne vp for ſeede, or vntill they are to be tranſplanted for ſeede, or elſe vntill Winter, while they are good, as euery one ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> How to order Artichokes, Melons, Cowcumbers, and Pompions.</head>
               <p>THere are certaine other herbes to be ſpoken of, which are wholly nourſed vp for their fruit ſake, of whom I ſhall not need to ſay much, being they are ſo frequent in euery place. Artichokes being planted of faire and large ſlips, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the roote in September and October (yet not too late) will moſt of them beare fruit the next yeare, ſo that they be planted in well dunged ground, and the earth raiſed vp like vnto an Anthill round about each roote, to defend them the better from the extreame froſts in Winter. Others plant ſlips in March and Aprill, or ſooner, but although ſome of them will beare fruit the ſame yeare, yet all will not. And indeede many doe rather chooſe to plant in the ſpring then in the fall, for that oftentimes an extreame hard Winter following the new ſetting of ſlips, when they haue not taken ſufficient heart and roote in the ground, doth vtterly pierce and periſh them, when as they that are ſet in the Spring haue the whole Summers growth, to make them ſtrong before they feele any ſharpe froſts, which by that time they are the better able to beare. Muske Melons haue beene begun to bee nourſed vp but of late dayes in this Land, wherein although many haue tryed and endeauoured to bring them to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet few haue attained vnto it: but thoſe rules and orders which the beſt and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt haue vſed, I will here ſet downe, that who ſo will, may haue as good and ripe Melons as any other in this Land. The firſt thing you are to looke vnto, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide you a peece of ground fit for the purpoſe, which is either a ſloping or ſheluing banke, lying open and oppoſite to the South Sunne, or ſome other fit place not ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and this ground alſo you muſt ſo prepare, that all the art you can vſe about it to make it rich is little enough; and therefore you muſt raiſe it with meere ſtable ſoyle, thorough rotten &amp; well turned vp, that it may be at the leaſt three foote deepe thereof, which you muſt caſt alſo into high beds or balkes, with deepe trenches or furrowes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, ſo as the ridges may be at the leaſt a foot and a halfe higher then the furrowes; for otherwiſe it is not poſſible to haue good Melons growe ripe. The choiſe of your ſeede alſo is another thing of eſpeciall regard, and the beſt is held to be Spaniſh, and not French, which hauing once gained, be ſure to haue ſtill of the ſame while they laſt <pb n="466" facs="tcp:15790:240"/> good, that you may haue the ſeede of your owne ripe Melons from them that haue eaten them, or ſaue ſome of the beſt your ſelfe for the purpoſe. I ſay while they laſt good; for many are of opinion, that no ſeede of Muske Melons gathered in England, will endure good to ſowe againe here aboue the third yeare, but ſtill they muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed from whence you had your choiſeſt before. Then hauing prepared a hot bed of dung in Aprill, ſet your ſeedes therein to raiſe them vp, and couer them, and order them with as great care or greater then Cowcumbers, &amp;c. are vſed, that when they are ready, they may be tranſplanted vpon the beds or balkes of that ground you had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared for them, and ſet them at the leaſt two yards in ſunder, euery one as it were in a hole, with a circle of dung about them, which vpon the ſetting being wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with water that hath ſtood in the Sunne a day or two, and ſo as often as neede is to water, couer them with ſtrawe (ſome vſe great hollow glaſſes like vnto bell heads) or ſome ſuch other things, to defend them both from the cold euenings or dayes, and the heate of the Sunne, while they are young and new planted. There are ſome that take vpon them great skill, that miſlike of the raiſing vp of Melons, as they doe alſo of Cowcumbers, on a hot bed of horſe dung, but will put two or three ſeedes in a place in the very ground where they ſhall ſtand and growe, and thinke without that former manner of forcing them forwards, that this their manner of planting will bring them on faſt and ſure enough, in that they will plucke away ſome of the worſt and weakeſt, if too many riſe vp together in a place; but let them know for certaine, that howſoeuer for Cowcumbers their purpoſe and order may doe reaſonable well, where the ground is rich and good, and where they ſtriue not to haue them ſo early, as they that vſe the other way, for Muske Melons, which are a more tender fruit, requiring greater care and trouble in the nourſing, and greater and ſtronger heate for the ripening, they muſt in our cold climate haue all the art vſed vnto them that may be, to bring them on the more early, and haue the more comfort of the Sunne to ripen them kindly, or elſe they will not bee worth the labour and ground. After you haue planted them as aforeſaid, ſome of good skill doe aduiſe, that you be carefull in any dry ſeaſon, to giue them wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter twice or thrice euery weeke while they are young, but more afterward when they are more growne, and that in the morning eſpecially, yea and when the fruit is growne ſomewhat great, to water the fruit it ſelfe with a watering pot in the heate of the day, is of ſo good effect, that it ripeneth them much faſter, and will giue them the better taſte and ſmell, as they ſay. To take likewiſe the fruit, and gather it at the full time of his ripeneſſe is no ſmall art; for if it be gathered before his due time to be preſently eaten, it will be hard and greene, and not eate kindly; and likewiſe if it be ſuffered too long, the whole goodneſſe will be loſt: You ſhall therefore know, that it is full time to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them to ſpend preſently, when they begin to looke a little yellowiſh on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and doe ſmell full and ſtrong; but if you be to ſend them farre off, or keepe them long vpon any occaſion, you ſhall then gather them ſo much the earlier, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the time of the carriage and ſpending, they may ripen in the lying, being kept dry, and couered with woollen clothes: When you cut one to eate, you ſhall know it to be ripe and good, if the ſeede and pulpe about them in the middle be very wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and will eaſily be ſeparated from the meate, and likewiſe if the meate looke yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and be mellow, and not hard or greene, and taſte full and pleaſant, and not wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: The vſuall manner to eate them is with pepper and ſalt, being pared and ſliced, and to drowne them in wine, for feare of doing more harme. Cowcumbers and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, after they are nourſed vp in the bed of hot dung, are to be ſeuerally tranſplanted, each of them on a large plot of ground, a good diſtance in ſunder: but the Pompions more, becauſe their branches take vp a great deale more ground, &amp; beſides, will require a great deale more watering, becauſe the fruit is greater. And thus haue you the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thoſe fruits which are of much eſteeme, eſpecially the two former, with all the better ſort of perſons; and the third kinde is not wholly refuſed of any, although it ſerueth moſt vually for the meaner and poorer ſort of people, after the firſt early ripe are ſpent.</p>

               <p>TYme, Sauory, and Hyſſope, are vſually ſowne in the Spring on beds by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, euerie one a part; but they that make a gaine by ſelling to others the young rootes, to ſet the knots or borders of Gardens, doe for the moſt part ſowe them in Iuly and Auguſt, that ſo being ſprung vp before Winter, they will be the fitter to be taken vp in the Spring following, to ſerue any mans vſe that would haue them. Sage, Lauender, and Roſemary, are altogether ſet in the Spring, by ſlipping the old ſtalkes, and taking the youngeſt and likelieſt of them, thruſting them either twined or otherwiſe halfe a foote deepe into the ground, and well watered vpon the ſetting; if any ſeaſonable weather doe follow, there is no doubt of their well thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: the hot Sunne and piercing drying Windes are the greateſt hinderances to them; and therefore I doe aduiſe none to ſet too ſoone in the Spring, nor yet in Autumne, as many doe practiſe: for I could neuer ſee ſuch come to good, for the extremity of the Winter comming vpon them ſo ſoone after their ſetting, will not ſuffer their young ſhootes to abide, not hauing taken ſufficient ſtrength in the ground, to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt ſuch violence, which doth often pierce the ſtrongeſt plants. Marierome and Baſſill are ſowne in the Spring, yet not too early; for they are tender plants, and doe not ſpring vntill the weather bee ſomewhat warme: but Baſſill would bee ſowne dry, and not haue any water of two or three daies after the ſowing, elſe the ſeede will turne to a gelly in the ground. Some vſe to ſowe the ſeed of Roſemary, but it ſeldome abideth the firſt Winter, becauſe the young plants being ſmall, and not of ſufficient ſtrength, cannot abide the ſharpneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of ſome Winters, notwithſtanding the couering of them, which killeth many old plants; but the vſuall way is to ſlippe and ſet, and ſo they thriue well. Many doe vſe to ſowe all or the moſt ſorts of Pot-herbes together on one plot of ground, that they neede not to goe farre to gather all the ſorts they would vſe. There are many ſorts of them well knowne vnto all, yet few or none doe vſe all ſorts, but as euery one liketh; ſome vſe thoſe that others refuſe, and ſome eſteem thoſe not to bee wholeſome and of a good relliſh, which others make no ſcruple of. The names of them are as followeth, and a ſhort relation of their ſowing or planting.</p>
               <p>Roſemary, Tyme, and Sauorie are ſpoken of before, and Onions and Leekes.</p>
               <p>Mints are to bee ſet with their rootes in ſome by-place, for that their rootes doe creepe ſo farre vnder ground, that they quickly fill vp the places neare adioyning, if they be not puld vp.</p>
               <p>Clarie is to be fowne, and ſeedeth and dyeth the next yeare, the herbe is ſtrong, and therefore a little thereof is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Nep is ſowne, and dyeth often after ſeeding, few doe vſe it, and that but a little at a time: both it and Clarie are more vſed in Tanſies then in Broths.</p>
               <p>Coſtmarie is to be ſet of rootes, the leaues are vſed with ſome in their Broths, but with more in their Ale.</p>

               <p>Parſley is a common herbe, and is ſowne of ſeede, it ſeedeth the next yeare and dyeth: the rootes are more vſed in broths then the leaues, and the leaues almoſt with all ſorts of meates.</p>
               <p>Fennell is ſowne of ſeede, and abideth many yeares yeelding ſeede: the rootes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are vſed in broths, and the leaues more ſeldome, yet ſerue to trimme vp many fiſh meates.</p>

               <p>Marigolds are ſowne of ſeede, and may be after tranſplanted, they abide two or three yeares, if they be not ſet in too cold a place: the leaues and flowers are both vſed.</p>
               <p>Langedebeefe is ſowne of ſeede, which ſhedding it ſelfe will hardly be deſtroyed in a Garden.</p>
               <p>Arrach is to be ſowne of ſeede, this likewiſe will riſe euery yeare of it owne ſeed, if it be ſuffered to ſhed it ſelfe.</p>

               <p>Blites are vſed but in ſome places; for there is a generall opinion held of them, that they are naught for the eyes: they are ſowne euery yeare of ſeede.</p>
               <p>Bloodwort once ſowne abideth many yeares, if the extremity of the froſts kill it not, and ſeedeth plentifully.</p>
               <p>Patience is of the ſame nature, and vſed in the ſame manner.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The manner and ordering of many ſorts of herbes and rootes for Sallets.</head>
               <p>IF I ſhould ſet downe all the ſorts of herbes that are vſually gathered for Sallets, I ſhould not onely ſpeake of Garden herbes, but of many herbes, &amp;c. that growe wilde in the fields, or elſe be but weedes in a Garden; for the vſuall manner with many, is to take the young buds and leaues of euery thing almoſt that groweth, as well in the Garden as in the Fields, and put them all together, that the taſte of the one may amend the relliſh of the other: But I will only ſhew you thoſe that are ſown or planted in gardens for that purpoſe. Aſparagus is a principall &amp; delectable Sallet herbe, whoſe young ſhootes when they are a good handfull high aboue the ground, are cut an inch within the ground, which being boyled, are eaten with a little vinegar and butter, as a Sallet of great delight. Their ordering with the beſt Gardiners is on this wiſe: When you haue prouided ſeede of the beſt kinde, you muſt ſowe it either before Chriſtmas, as moſt doe, or before the end of February; the later you ſowe, the later and the more hardly will they ſpring: after they are growne vp, they are to be tranſplanted in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne on a bed well trenched in with dung; for elſe they will not bee worth your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſet about a foote diſtance in ſunder, and looke that the more carefull you are in the replanting of them, the better they will thriue, and the ſooner great: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fiue or ſix yeares ſtanding they vſually doe decay; and therefore they that ſtriue to haue continually faire and great heads, doe from ſeede raiſe vp young for their ſtore. You muſt likewiſe ſee that you cut not your heads or young ſhoote too nigh, or too much, that is, to take away too many heads from a roote, but to leaue a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vncut, otherwiſe it will kill the heart of your rootes the ſooner, cauſing them to dye, or to giue very ſmall heads or ſhootes; for you may well conſider with your ſelfe, that if the roote haue not head enough left it aboue the ground to ſhoote greene this yeare, it will not, nor cannot proſper vnder ground to giue encreaſe the next yeare. The ordering of Lettice I haue ſpoken of before, and ſhall not neede here to repeate what hath beene already ſaid, but referre you thereunto for the ſowing, planting, &amp;c. onely I will here ſhew you the manner of ordering them for Sallets. There are ſome ſorts of Lettice that growe very great, and cloſe their heads, which are called Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:15790:241"/> Lettice, both ordinary and extraordinary, and there are other ſorts of great Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that are open, and cloſe not, or cabbage not at all, which yet are of an excellent kinde, if they be vſed after that eſpeciall manner is fit for them, which is, That when they are planted (for after they are ſowne, they muſt be tranſplanted) of a reaſonable diſtance in ſunder, and growne to be of ſome bigneſſe, euery one of them muſt bee tyed together with baſt or thread toward the toppes of the leaues, that by this meanes all the inner leaues may growe whitiſh, which then are to be cut vp and vſed: for the keeping of the leaues cloſe doth make them taſte delicately, and to bee very tender. And theſe ſorts of Lettice for the moſt part are ſpent after Summer is paſt, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lettice are not to be had. Lambes Lettice or Corne Sallet is an herbe, which abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all Winter, is the firſt Sallet herbe of the yeare that is vſed before any ordinarie Lettice is ready; it is therefore vſually ſowne in Auguſt, when the ſeede thereof is ripe. Purſlane is a Summer Sallet herbe, and is to be ſowne in the Spring, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what late, becauſe it is tender, and ioyeth in warmth; and therefore diuers haue ſowne it vpon thoſe beddes of dung, whereon they nourſed vp their Cowcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, &amp;c. after they are taken away, which being well and often watered, hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Sallet vntill the end of the yeare. Spinach is ſowne in the Spring, of all for the moſt part that vſe it, but yet if it be ſowne in Summer it will abide greene all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then ſeedeth quickly: it is a Sallet that hath little or no taſte at all therein, like as Lettice and Purſlane; and therefore Cookes know how to make many a good diſh of meate with it, by putting Sugar and Spice thereto. Coleworts are of diuers kinds, and although ſome of them are wholly ſpent among the poorer ſort of people, yet ſome kindes of them may be dreſſed and ordered as may delight a curious palate, which is, that being boyled tender, the middle ribs are taken cold, and laid in diſhes, and vinegar and oyle poured thereon, and ſo eaten. Coleflowers are to be had in this Countrey but very ſeldome, for that it is hard to meete with good ſeede: it muſt bee ſowne on beds of dung to force it forward, or elſe it would periſh with the froſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had giuen his head of flowers, and tranſplanted into verie good and rich ground, leſt you loſe the benefit of your labours. Endiue is of two ſorts, the ordinary, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that hath the edges of the leaues curld or crumpled; it is to be whited, to make it the more dainty Sallet, which is vſually done in this manner: After they are grown to ſome reaſonable greatneſſe (but in any caſe before they ſhoote forth a ſtalke in the midſt for ſeede) they are to be taken vp, and the rootes being cut away, lay them to dry or wither for three or foure houres, and then bury them in ſand, ſo as none of them lye one vpon another, or if you can, one to touch another, which by this meanes will change whitiſh, and thereby become verie tender, and is a Sallet both for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne and Winter. Succorie is vſed by ſome in the ſame manner, but becauſe it is more bitter then Endiue, it is not ſo generally vſed, or rather vſed but of a verie few: and whereas Endiue will ſeede the ſame yeare it is ſowne, and then dye, Succorie abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth manie yeares, the bitterneſſe thereof cauſing it to be more Phyſicall to open ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; and therefore the flowers pickled vp, as diuers other flowers are vſed to be now adaies, make a delicate Sallet at all times when there is occaſion to vſe them. Of red Beetes, the rootes are onely vſed both boyled and eaten cold with vinegar and oyle, and is alſo vſed to trimme vp or garniſh forth manie ſorts of diſhes of meate: the ſeede of the beſt kinde will not abide good with vs aboue three yeares, but will dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and growe worſe; and therefore thoſe that delight therein muſt be curious, to be prouided from beyond Sea, that they may haue ſuch as will giue delight. Sorrell is an herbe ſo common, and the vſe ſo well knowne, both for ſawce, and to ſeaſon broths and meates for the ſound as well as ſicke perſons, that I ſhall not neede to ſay anie more thereof. Cheruill is a Sallet herbe of much vſe, both with French and Dutch, who doe much more delight in herbes of ſtronger taſte then the Engliſh doe: it is ſowne early, and vſed but a while, becauſe it quickly runneth vp to ſeede. Sweete Cheruill, or as ſome call it, Sweete Cis, is ſo like in taſte vnto Aniſe ſeede, that it much delighteth the taſte among other herbes in a Sallet: the ſeede is long, thicke, blacke, and cornered, and muſt be ſowne in the end of Autumne, that it may lye in the ground all the Winter, and then it will ſhoote out in the Spring, or elſe if it be ſowne in the Spring, it will not ſpring vp that yeare vntill the next: the leaues (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) are vſed among other herbes: the rootes likewiſe are not onely cordiall, but alſo held to be preſeruatiue againſt the Plague, either greene, dryed, or preſeru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d <pb n="470" facs="tcp:15790:242"/> with ſugar. Rampion rootes are a kinde of Sallet with a great many, being boyled tender, and eaten cold with vinegar and pepper. Creſſes is an herbe of eaſie and quick growth, and while it is young eaten eyther alone, or with parſley and other herbes: it is of a ſtrong taſte to them that are not accuſtomed thereunto, but it is much vſed of ſtrangers. Rocket is of the ſame nature and qualitie, but ſomewhat ſtronger in taſte: they are both ſowen in the Spring, and riſe, ſeede and dye the ſame yeare. Tarragon is an herbe of as ſtrong a taſte as eyther Rocket or Creſſes, it abideth and dyeth not euery yeare, nor yet giueth ripe ſeede (as far as euer could bee found with vs) any yeare, but maketh ſufficient increaſe within the ground, ſpreading his roots all abroad a great way off. Muſtard is a common ſawce both with fiſh and fleſh, and the ſeed thereof (and no part of the plant beſides) is well knowne how to be vſed being grownded, as euery one I thinke knoweth. The rootes of horſe Radiſh likewiſe beeing grownd like Muſtard, is vſed both of ſtrangers and our owne nation, as ſawce for fiſh. Tanſie is of great vſe, almoſt with all manner of perſons in the Spring of the yeare: it is more vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally planted of the rootes then otherwiſe; for in that the rootes ſpread far and neere they may be eaſily taken away, without any hurt to the reſt of the rootes. Burnet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be more vſed in wine in the Summer time then any way elſe, yet it is likewiſe made a ſallet herbe with many, to amend the harſh or weak relliſh of ſome other herbs. Skirrets are better to be ſowen of the ſeed then planted from the roots, and will come on more ſpeedily, and be fairer rootes: they are as often eaten cold as a Sallet, being boyled and the pith taken out, as ſtewed with butter and eaten warme. Let not Parſley and Fenell be forgotten among your other Sallet herbes, wherof I haue ſpoken before, and therefore need ſay no more of them. The flowers of Marigolds pickt cleane from the heads, and pickled vp againſt winter, make an excellent Sallet when no flowers are to be had in a garden. Cloue Gilloflowers likewiſe preſerued or pickled vp in the ſame manner (which is <hi>ſtratum ſuper ſtratum,</hi> a lay of flowers, and then ſtrawed ouer with fine dry and poudered Sugar, and ſo lay after lay ſtrawed ouer, vntill the pot bee full you meane to keepe them in, and after filled vp or couered ouer with vinegar) make a Sallet now adayes in the higheſt eſteeme with Gentles and Ladies of the greateſt note: the planting and ordering of them both is ſpoken of ſeuerally in their proper places. Goates bearbe that groweth in Gardens only, as well as that which groweth wilde in Medowes, &amp;c. bearing a yellow flower, are vſed as a Sallet, the rootes beeing boyled and pared are eaten cold with vinegar, oyle and pepper; or elſe ſtewed with butter and eaten warme as Skirrets, Parſneps &amp;c. And thus haue you here ſet downe all thoſe moſt vſuall Sallets are vſed in this Kingdome: I ſay the moſt vſuall, or that are nourſed vp in Gardens; for I know there are ſome other wilde herbes and rootes, as Dandelion &amp;c. but they are vſed onely of ſtrangers, and of thoſe whoſe curioſitie ſearcheth out the whole worke of nature to ſatisfie their deſires.</p>

And although I doe recite ſome that are mentioned in other places, yet I thought it meete to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them altogether in one place.

Rue or Herbe grace is a ſtrong herbe, yet vſed inwardly againſt the plague as an Antidote with Figs and Wall-nuts, and helpeth much againſt windy bodies: outwardly it is vſed to bee layde to the wreſtes of the hands, to driue away agues: it is more vſually planted of ſlips then raiſed from ſeede, and abideth long if ſharpe froſtes kill it not. Dragons being diſtilled are held to be good to expell any euill thing from the heart: they are altogether planted of the rootes. Setwall, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian, or Capons tayle, the herbe often, but the roote much better, is vſed to prouoke ſweating, thereby to expell euill vapours that might annoy the heart: it is only plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the rootes when they are taken vp, and the young replanted. Aſarabacca, the leaues are often vſed to procure vomiting being ſtamped, and the ſtrained iuice to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle quantitie, put into a draught of ale and drunke, thereby to eaſe the ſtomacke of many euill and groſſe humours that there lye and offend it; diuers alſo take the leaues and rootes a little boyled in wine, with a little ſpice added thereunto, to expell both tertian and quartan agues: the rootes of our Engliſh growing is more auaileable for theſe purpoſes then any outlandiſh: it is planted by the roote; for I could neuer ſee it ſpring of ſeede. Maſterwort commeth ſomewhat neere in propertie vnto Angelica, and beſides very effectuall to diſperſe winde in the bodie, whether of the collicke or otherwiſe; as alſo very profitable to comfort in all cold cauſes: it yeeldeth ſeede, but yet is more vſually planted from the rootes being parted. Balme is a cordiall herbe both in ſmell and taſte, and is wholly vſed for thoſe purpoſes, that is, to comfort the heart being diſtilled into water either ſimple or compound, or the herbe dryed and vſed: it is ſet of the rootes being parted, becauſe it giueth no ſeede that euer I could obſerue. Camomill is a common herbe well knowne, and is planted of the rootes in alleyes, in walkes, and on bankes to ſit on, for that the more it is troden on, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed downe in dry weather, the cloſer it groweth, and the better it will thriue: the vſe thereof is very much, both to warme and comfort, and to eaſe paines being applyed outwardly after many faſhions: the decoction alſo of the flowers prouoketh ſweat, and they are much vſed againſt agues. Featherfew is an herbe of greater vſe for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men then for men, to diſſolue flatulent or windy humours, which cauſeth the paines of the mother: ſome vſe to take the iuice thereof in drinke for agues: it is as well ſowen of the ſeede as planted of the rootes. Coſtmary is vſed among thoſe herbes that are put in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Maudlin is held to be a principall good herbe to open and cleanſe the liuer, and for that purpoſe is vſed many wayes, as in ale, in tanſies, and in broths &amp;c. the ſeed alſo is vſed, and ſo is the herbe alſo ſometimes, to kill the wormes in children: it is ſowen of the ſeede, and planted alſo of the ſeparated rootes. Caſſidonie is a ſmall kinde of Lauender, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering both in forme and qualitie: it is much vſed for the head to eaſe paines thereof, as alſo put among other things to purge melancholicke diſeaſes: it is ſowen of ſeede, and abideth not a winter vnleſſe it bee well defended, and yet hardly giueth ripe ſeede againe with vs. Smallage is a great opening herbe, and much more then eyther Parſley or Fenell, and the rootes of them all are often vſed together in medicines: it is ſowen of ſeede, and will not bee wanting in a Garden if once you ſuffer it to ſow it ſelfe. Cardus Benedictus, or the Bleſſed Thiſtle, is much vſed in the time of any infection or plague, as alſo to expell any euill ſymptome from the heart at all other times. It is vſed likewiſe to be boyled in poſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Winter Cherries are likewiſe nurſed vp in diuers gardens, for that their propertie is to giue helpe to them that are troubled eyther with the ſtopping or heate of their v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine the herbe and berries are often diſtilled, but the berries alone are more often vſed: after it is once planted in a garden it will runne vnder ground, &amp; abide well enough, Celondine is held to bee good for the iaundiſe, it is much vſed for to cleere dim eyes, eyther the iuice or the water dropped into them: it is ſowen of ſeede, and being once brought into a garden, will hardly be weeded out; the ſeede that ſheddeth will ſo ſow it ſelfe, and therefore ſome corner in a garden is the fitteſt place for it. Tabacco is of two ſorts, and both vſed to be planted in Gardens, yet the Engliſh kinde (as it is called) is more to be found in our Countrey Gardens then the Indian ſort: the leaues of both ſorts indifferently, that is, of eyther of which is next at hand, being ſtamped and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <pb n="472" facs="tcp:15790:243"/> eyther by it ſelfe, or with other herbes in oyle or hogs ſuet, doe make an excellent ſalue for greene wounds, and alſo to clenſe old vlcers or ſores; the iuice of the greene leaues drunke in ale, or a dryed leafe ſteeped in wine or ale for a night, and the wine or ale drunke in the morning, prouoketh to caſt, but the dryed leafe much ſtronger then the greene: they are ſowen of ſeede, but the Indian kinde is more tender, and will not abide a winter with vs abroade. Spurge that vſually groweth in Gardens, is a violent purger, and therefore it is needfull to be very carefull how it is vſed: the ſeede is more ordinarily vſed then any other part of the plant, which purgeth by vomiting in ſome, and both vpwards and downwards in many; the iuice of the herbe, but eſpecially the milke thereof, is vſed to kill wartes: it is ſowen of ſeede, and when it doth once ſhed it ſelfe, it will ſtill continue ſpringing of the fallen ſeede. Bearefoote is ſowen of ſeed, and will hardly abide tranſplanting vnleſſe it bee while it is young; yet abideth diuers yeares, if it ſtand not in too cold a place. This I ſpeake of the greater kinde; for the lower ſmall wilde kind (which is the moſt ordinary in this land) will neuer decay: the leaues are ſometimes vſed greene, but moſt vſually dryed and poudered, and giuen in drinke to them that haue the wormes: it purgeth melancholy, but eſpecially the roots. In many Countries of this Land, and elſewhere, they vſe to thruſt the ſtalk of the great kinde through the eare or dewlap of Kine and Cattell, to cure them of many diſeaſes. Salomons Seale, or (as ſome call it) Ladder to heauen, although it doth grow wilde in many places of this Land, yet is planted in Gardens: it is accounted an excellent wound herbe to conſolidate, and binde, inſomuch that many vſe it with good ſucceſſe to cure ruptures, and to ſtay both the white and the red fluxe in women: it is planted altogether of the rootes, for I could neuer finde it ſpring from the ſeede, it is ſo ſtrong. Comfry likewiſe is found growing wilde in many places by ditch ſides, and in moiſt places, and therefore requireth ſome moiſt places of the garden: it is wholly vſed for knitting, binding, and conſolidating fluxes and wounds, to be applyed either inwardly or outwardly: The rootes are ſtronger for thoſe purpoſes then any other parts of the plant. Licoris is much vſed now adaies to bee planted in great quantitie, euen to fill many acres of ground, whereof riſeth a great deale of profit to thoſe that know how to order it, and haue fit grounds for it to thriue in; for euery ground will not be aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious: It will require a very rich, deepe and mellow ground, eyther naturall or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall; but for a priuate houſe where a ſmall quantitie will ſerue, there needeth not ſo much curioſitie: it is vſually planted of the top heads, when the lower rootes (which are the Licoris that is vſed) and the runners are cut from them. Some vſe to make an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary drinke or beuerage of Licoris, boyled in water as our vſuall ale or beere is with malt, which fermented with barme in the ſame manner, and tunned vp, ſerueth in ſtead thereof, as I am credibly informed: It is otherwiſe in a manner wholly ſpent for colds, coughes and rheumes, to expectorate flegme, but vſed in diuers formes, as in iuice, in decoctions, ſyrrups, roules, trochiſces, and the greene or dryed roote of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the moſt ordinary Phyſicall herbes that are vſed to be planted in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens for the vſe of any Country familie, that is (as I ſaid before) farre remote from Phyſitians or Cbirurgions abidings, that they may vſe as occaſion ſerueth for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or their neighbours, and by a little care and paines in the applying may doe a great deale of good, and ſometimes to them that haue not wherewith to ſpend on themſelues, much leſſe on Phyſitians or Chirurgions, or if they haue, may oftentimes receiue leſſe good at their hands then at others that are taught by experience in their owne families, to be the more able to giue helpe to others.</p>

                     <p>PEnnyroyall alſo is an herbe ſo well knowne, that I ſhall not neede to ſpend much time in the deſcription of it: hauing many weake round ſtalkes, diuided into ſundry branches, rather leaning or lying vpon the ground then ſtanding vpright, whereon are ſet at ſeuerall ioynts, ſmall roundiſh darke greene leaues: the flowers are purpliſh that grow in gardens, yet ſome that grow wilde are white, or more white then purple, ſet in roundles about the tops of the branches; the ſtalkes ſhoote forth ſmall fibres or rootes at the ioynts, as it lyeth vpon the ground, thereby faſtening it ſelfe therein, and quickly increaſeth, and ouer-runneth any ground, eſpecially in the ſhade or any moiſt place, and is replanted by breaking the ſprouted ſtalkes, and ſo quickely groweth.</p>
                     <p>Other ſorts of Pennyroyall are fit for the Phyſicke Garden, or Garden of Simples.</p>

                        <p>It is very good and wholeſome for the lunges, to expell cold thin flegme, and afterwards to warme and dry it vp: and is alſo of the like propertie as Mintes, to comfort the ſtomacke, and ſtay vomiting. It is alſo vſed in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens baths and waſhings: and in mens alſo to comfort the ſinewes. It is yet to this day, as it hath beene in former times, vſed to bee put into puddings, and ſuch like meates of all ſorts, and therefore in diuers places they know it by no other name then Pudding-graſſe.</p>
                        <p>The former age of our great Grandfathers, had all theſe hot herbes in much and familiar vſe, both for their meates and medicines, and therewith preſerued themſelues in long life and much health: but this delicate age of ours, which is not pleaſed with any thing almoſt, be it meat or medicine, that is not pleaſant to the palate, doth wholly refuſe theſe almoſt, and therefore cannot be partaker of the benefit of them.</p>

It is alſo vſed by diuers to be ſtilled, being ſteeped in Ale, to make a Baulme water, after the manner they haue beene taught, which they keepe by them, to vſe in the ſtead of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> when they haue any occaſion for their owne or their neighbours Families, in ſuddaine qualmes or paſſions of the heart: but if they had a little better direction (for this is ſomewhat too rude) it would doe them more good that take it: For the herbe without all queſtion is an excellent helpe to comfort the heart, as the very ſmell may induce any ſo to beleeue. It is alſo good to heale greene wounds, being made into ſalues: and I verily thinke, that our forefathers hearing of the healing and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table properties of the true naturall Baulme, and finding this herbe to be ſo effectuall, gaue it the name of Baulme, in imitation of his properties and vertues. It is alſo an herbe wherein Bees doe much delight, as hath beene found by experience of thoſe that haue kept great ſtore; if the Hiues bee rubbed on the inſide with ſome thereof, and as they thinke it draweth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the ſmell thereof to reſort thither.

The ancient Authors, as by their workes appeare, knew but two ſorts, the white and the blacke Beete, whereof the white is ſufficiently known, and was of them termed
<hi>Sicula,</hi> of the later Phyſitians <hi>Sicla,</hi> becauſe it was thought firſt to be brought from Sicilie: the blacke abideth ſome controuerſie; ſome thinking that our common greene Beete, becauſe it is of a darke greene colour, was that they called the blacke Beete; others that our ſmall red Beete, which is of a darke red colour, was their black Beete, which in my opinion is the more likely: But to come to the matter in hand, and giue you the deſcriptions of them which are in vſe with vs, and leaue controuerſies to ſuch a worke as is fit for them, wherein all ſuch matters may be diſcuſſed at large.</p>
                     <p>The common white Beete hath many great leaues next the ground (in ſome hot Countries growing to be three foote long, and very broade, in our Countrey they are very large, but nothing neere that proportion) of a whitiſh greene colour; the ſtalke is great, ſtrong, and ribbed or creſted, bearing great ſtore of leaues vpon it vp to the very toppe almoſt: the flowers grow in very long tufts, ſmall at the ends, and turning down their heads, which are ſmall pale greeniſh yellow burres, giuing cornered prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeede: the roote is great, long and hard, when it hath giuen ſeede, of no vſe at all, but abideth a former winter with leaues vpon it, as all other ſorts following do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>The common red Beet differeth not from the white Beete, but only that it is not ſo great, and both the leaues and rootes are ſomewhat red: the leaues bee in ſome more red then in others, which haue but red veines or ſtrakes in them, in ſome alſo of a freſh red, in others very darke red: the roote hereof is red, ſpongy, and not vſed to bee eaten.</p>
                     <p>The common greene Beete is alſo like vnto the white Beete, but of a darke greene colour.

                        <p>The rootes of the Romane red Beete being boyled, are eaten of diuers while they are hot with a little oyle and vinegar, and is accounted a delicate ſallet for the winter; and being cold they are ſo vſed and eaten likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>The leaues are much vſed to mollifie and open the belly, being vſed in the decoction of Gliſters.

Our common Parſley is ſo well knowne, that it is almoſt needleſſe to deſcribe it, hauing diuers freſh greene leaues, three alwaies placed together on a ſtalke, and ſnipt about the edges, and three ſtalkes of leaues for the moſt part growing together: the ſtalkes growe three or foure foote high or better, bearing ſpikie heads of white flowers, which turne into ſmall ſeede, ſomewhat ſharpe and hot in taſte: the roote is long and white.</p>
                     <p>Curld Parſley hath his leaues curled or crumpled on the edges, and therein is the onely difference from the former.</p>

                        <pb n="492" facs="tcp:15790:253"/>Virginia Parſley is in his leafe altogether like vnto common Parſley for the forme, conſiſting of three leaues ſet together, but that the leaues are as large as Smallage leaues, but of a pale or whitiſh greene colour, and of the ſame taſte of our common Parſley: the ſeede hereof is as the leaues, twice if not thrice as bigge as the ordinary Parſley, and periſheth when it hath giuen ſeede, abiding vſually the firſt yeare of the ſowing.</p>
                     <p>Smallage is in forme ſomewhat like vnto Parſley, but greater and greener, and leſſe pleaſant, or rather more bitter in taſte: the ſeede is ſmaller, and the root more ſtringy.</p>

                        <p>The ſeed alſo is vſed for the ſame cauſe, when any are troubled with the ſtone, or grauell, to open the paſſages of vrine.</p>

The other ſweete Fenell is not much knowne, and called Cardus Fenell by thoſe that ſent it out of Italy, whoſe leaues are more thicke and buſhie then any of the other. Our common Fenell, whereof there is greene and red, hath many faire and large ſpread leaues, finely cut and diuided into many ſmall, long, greene, or reddiſh leaues, yet the thicker tufted the branches be, the ſhorter are the leaues: the ſtalkes are round, with diuers ioynts and leaues at them, growing fiue or ſix foot high, bearing at the top many ſpoakie rundels of yellow flowers: the Common, I meane, doth turne into a darke grayiſh flat ſeede, and the Sweete into larger and yellower: the roote is great, long, and white, and endureth diuers yeares.</p>

                     <p>SPinach or Spinage is of three ſorts (yet ſome doe reckon of foure, accounting that herbe that beareth no ſeede to be a ſort of it ſelfe, when it is but an accident of nature, as it falleth out in Hempe, Mercury, and diuers other herbes) two that bear prickly ſeed, the one much greater then the other: the third that beareth a ſmooth ſeede, which is more daintie, and nourſed vp but in few Gardens: The common Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach which is the leſſer of the two prickly ſorts, hath long greene leaues, broad at the ſtalke, and rent, or torne as it were into foure corners, and ſharpe pointed at the ends: it quickly runneth vp to ſtalke, if it be ſowen in the Spring time; but elſe, if at the end of Summer, it will abide all the winter green, and then ſuddenly in the very beginning of the Spring, runne vp to ſtalke, bearing many leaues both below and at the toppe, where there doth appeare many ſmal greeniſh flowers in cluſters, and after them prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeede: The other greater ſort that hath prickly ſeede, is in all things like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but larger both in ſtalke, leafe and ſeede. The ſmooth Spinach hath broader, and a little rounder pointed leaues then the firſt, eſpecially the lower leaues; for thoſe that grow vpwards vpon the ſtalke, are more pointed, and as it were three ſquare, of as darke a greene colour as the former: at the ſeuerall ioynts of the ſtalkes and branches, ſtand cluſtering many ſmall greeniſh flowers, which turne into cluſters of round whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſeede, without any prickles at all vpon them: the roote is long, white and ſmall, like vnto the other, with many fibres at it: If it be often cut, it will grow the thicker, or elſe ſpindle vp very thinly, and with but few leaues vpon the ſtalke.</p>

                        <p>Spinage is an herbe fit for ſallets, and for diuers other purpoſes for the table only; for it is not knowne to bee vſed Phyſically at all. Many Engliſh that haue learned it of the Dutch people, doe ſtew the herbe in a pot or pipkin, without any other moiſture then it owne, and after the moiſture is a little preſſed from it, they put butter, and a little ſpice vnto it, and make therewith a diſh that many delight to eate of. It is vſed likewiſe to be made into Tartes, and many other varieties of diſhes, as Gentlewomen and their Cookes can better tell then my ſelfe; vnto whom I leaue the further orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe herbes, and all other fruits and rootes of this Garden: For I intend only to giue you the knowledge of them, with ſome briefe notes for their vſe, and no more.</p>

                     <p>THere are ſo many ſorts, and ſo great diuerſitie of Lettice, that I doubt I ſhall ſcarce be beleeued of a great many. For I doe in this Chapter reckon vp vnto you eleauen or twelue differing ſorts; ſome of little vſe, others of more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more common and vulgar; and ſome that are of excellent vſe and ſeruice, which are more rare, and require more knowledge and care for the ordering of them, as alſo for their time of ſpending, as ſome in the ſpring, ſome in ſummer, others in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne, and ſome being whited for the winter. For all theſe ſorts I ſhall not neede ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſcriptions, but only ſhew you which doe cabbage, and which are looſe, which of of them are great or ſmall, white, greene or red, and which of them beare white ſeeds, and which of them blacke. And laſtly I haue thought good to adde another Sallet herbe, which becauſe it is called Lambes Lettice of many, or Corne Sallet of others, is put in only to fill vp a number in this Chapter, and that I muſt ſpeake of it, and not that I thinke it to be any of the kindes of Lettice.</p>
                     <p>All ſorts of Lettice, after a while that they haue cloſed themſelues, if they bee of the Cabbage kindes, or otherwiſe being looſe, and neuer cloſing, ſend forth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the middle of their leaues a round ſtalke (in ſome greater, in others leſſer, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their kinde) full of leaues like vnto the lower, branching at the toppe into ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts, whereon grow diuers ſmall ſtar-like flowers, of a pale yellowiſh colour; after which come ſeede, eyther white or blackiſh, as the plant yeeldeth, whereat hangeth ſome ſmall peece of a cottony doune, wherewith the whole head is ſtored, and is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the winde, if it be not gathered in time: the roote is ſomewhat long and white, with ſome fibres at it, and periſheth quickely after the ſeede is ripe.</p>
                     <p>The Romane red Lettice is the beſt and greateſt of all the reſt. For Iohn Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cante that firſt, as I thinke, brought it into England, and ſowed it, did write vnto mee, that after one of them had been bound and whited, when the refuſe was cut away, the reſt weighed ſeuenteene ounces: this hath blacke ſeede.</p>
                     <p>The white Romane Lettice is like vnto it, hauing long leaues like a Teaſell, it is in goodneſſe next vnto the red, but muſt be whited, that it may eate kindly: the ſeede hereof is white.</p>
                     <p>The Virginia Lettice hath ſingle and very broade reddiſh leaues, and is not of any great regard, and therefore is kept but of a few: it beareth blacke ſeede.</p>
                     <p>The common Lumbard Lettice that is looſe, and another kinde thereof that doth ſomewhat cabbage, haue both white ſeedes.</p>
                     <p>The Venice Lettice is an excellent Cabbage Lettice, and is beſt to bee ſowen after Midſummer for lateward Lettice; they be ſometimes as great as the crowne of a mans hatt: the ſeede hereof is white, and groweth to be of a meane height.</p>
                     <p>Our common Cabbage Lettice is well known, and beareth blacke ſeede.</p>
                     <p>The curld Lettice which is open, and differeth but little from Endiue, beareth black ſeede.</p>
                     <p>Another ſort of curld Lettice doth cabbage, and is called Flanders Cropers, or Cropers of Bruges; this groweth loweſt, and hath the ſmalleſt head, but very hard and round, and white while it groweth: the ſeed is blacke.</p>
                     <p>A kinde of Romane Lettice is of a darke green colour, growing as low as the Venice Lettice, and is an excellent kinde, bearing blacke ſeede.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly our winter Lettice is wonderfull hardy to endure our cold: It is but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and muſt be ſowen at Michaelmas, but will be very good, before any of the other good ſorts ſowen in the Spring, will be ready to be vſed, and beareth white ſeed.</p>
                     <p>To inſtruct a nouice (for I teach not a Gardiner of knowledge) how to gather his ſeede that it may be good, is in this manner: Let him marke out thoſe plants that hee meaneth ſhall run vp for ſeede, which muſt be the moſt likely; &amp; after they haue begun to ſhoote forth ſtalkes, ſtrip away the lower leaues, for two or three hands breadth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ground, that thereby in taking away the loweſt leaues, the ſtalke doe not rot, nor the ſeed be hindered in the ripening.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="499" facs="tcp:15790:256"/>There are two manner of wayes to whiten Lettice to make them eate the more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: the one is by rayſing vp earth like moale hils, round about the plants while they are growing, which will make them grow white: the other is by tying vp all the looſe leaues round together while it groweth, that ſo the cloſe tying may make it grow white, and thereby be the more tender.</p>
                     <p>Lambes Lettice or Corne Sallet is a ſmall plant while it is young, growing cloſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, with many whitiſh greene, long and narrow, round pointed leaues, all the winter, and in the beginning of the ſpring (if it bee ſowen in autumne, as it is vſuall to ſerue for an early ſallet) riſeth vp with ſmall round ſtalkes, with two leaues at euery ioynt, branching forth at the toppe, and bearing tufts of ſmall bleake blew flowers, which turne into ſmall round whitiſh ſeede: the roote is ſmall and long, with ſome ſmall threds hanging thereat: the whole plant is of a wateriſh taſte, almoſt inſipide.</p>

                        <p>All ſorts of Lettice are ſpent in ſallets, with oyle and vinegar, or as euery one pleaſe, for the moſt part, while they are freſh and greene, or whited, as is declared of ſome of the ſorts before, to cauſe them to eate the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and tender.

                        <p>They all coole a hot and fainting ſtomacke.</p>
                        <p>The iuice of Lettice applyed with oyle of Roſes to the foreheads of the ſicke and weake wanting ſleepe, procureth reſt, and taketh away paines in the head: bound likewiſe to the cods, it helpeth thoſe that are troubled with the Colts euill. If a little camphire be added, it reſtraineth immoderate luſt: but it is hurtfull to ſuch as are troubled with the ſhortneſſe of breath.</p>
                        <p>Lambes Lettice is wholly ſpent for ſallets, in the beginning of the yeare, as I ſaid, before any almoſt of the other ſorts of Lettice are to be had.</p>

                     <p>THere is greater diuerſity in the forme and colour of the leaues of this plant, then there is in any other that I know groweth vpon the ground. But this place requireth not the knowledge of all ſorts which might be ſhewen, many of them being of no vſe with vs for the table, but for delight, to behold the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full variety of the workes of God herein. I will here therefore ſhew you onely thoſe ſorts that are ordinary in moſt Gardens, and ſome that are rare, receiued into ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall Gardens: And firſt of Cabbages, and then of Coleworts.</p>
                     <p>Our ordinary Cabbage that cloſeth hard and round, hath at the firſt great large thicke leaues, of a grayiſh greene colour, with thicke great ribbes, and lye open moſt part of the Summer without cloſing, but toward the end of Summer, being growne to haue many leaues, it then beginneth to growe cloſe and round in the middle, and as it cloſeth, the leaues growe white inward; yet there be ſome kindes that will neuer be ſo cloſe as theſe, but will remaine halfe open, which wee doe not account to be ſo good as the other: in the middle of this head, the next yeare after the ſowing, in other Countries eſpecially, and ſometimes in ours, if the Winter be milde, as may be ſeene in diuers Gardens (but to preuent the danger of our Winter froſts, our Gardiners now doe vſe to take vp diuers Cabbages with their rootes, and tying a cloth or ſome ſuch thing about the rootes, doe hang them vp in their houſes, where they may be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from cold, and then ſet them againe after the froſts are paſt) and then there ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out a great thicke ſtalke, diuided at the toppe into many branches, bearing thereon diuers ſmall flowers, ſometime white, but moſt commonly yellow, made of foure leaues, which turne into long, round, and pointed pods, containing therein ſmall <pb n="504" facs="tcp:15790:259"/> round ſeede, like vnto Turnep ſeede: the roote ſpreadeth not farre nor deepe, and dyeth vſually in any great froſte; for a ſmall froſt maketh the Cabbage eate the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.</p>
                     <p>The red Cabbage is like vnto the white, laſt ſpoken of, but differing in colour and greatneſſe; for it is ſeldome found ſo great as the white, and the colour of the leaues is very variable, as being in ſome ſtript with red, in others more red, or very deepe red or purple.</p>
                     <p>The ſugar loafe Cabbage, ſo called becauſe it is ſmaller at the toppe then it is at the bottome, and is of two ſorts, the one white, the other greene.</p>
                     <p>The Sauoy Cabbadge, one is of a deepe greene coloured leafe, and curld when it is to be gathered; the other is yellowiſh: neyther of both theſe doe cloſe ſo well as the firſt, but yet are vſed of ſome, and accounted good.</p>
                     <p>The Cole flower is a kinde of Coleworte, whoſe leaues are large, and like the Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage leaues, but ſomewhat ſmaller, and endented about the edges, in the middle wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſometimes in the beginning of Autumne, and ſometimes much ſooner, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth a hard head of whitiſh yellow tufts of flowers, cloſely thruſt together, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer open, nor ſpreading much with vs, which then is fitteſt to be vſed, the green leaues being cut away cloſe to the head: this hath a much pleaſanter taſte then eyther the Coleworte, or Cabbage of any kinde, and is therefore of the more regard and reſpect at good mens tables.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary Coleworte is ſufficiently knowne not to cloſe or cabbage, and giueth ſeede plentifully enough.</p>
                     <p>The other Colewortes that are nourſed vp with thoſe that delight in curioſities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the aforeſaid ordinary greene, which is much vſed of Dutchmen, and other ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, are theſe: The Curld Coleworte eyther wholly of a greene colour, or of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers colours in one plant, as white, yellow, red, purple or crimſon, ſo variably mixed, the leaues being curld on the edges, like a ruffe band, that it is very beautifull to behold.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another curld Colewort of leſſe beauty and reſpect, being but a little curld on the edges, whoſe leaues are white, edged with red, or green edged with white.</p>
                     <p>Two other there are, the one of a popingaye greene colour: the other of a fine deepe greene, like vnto the Sauoyes.</p>
                     <p>Then there is the Cole rape, which is alſo a kinde of Coleworte, that beareth a white heade, or headed ſtalke aboue the ground, as bigge as a reaſonable Turnep, but longer, and from the toppe thereof ſpringeth out diuers great leaues, like vnto Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wortes; among which riſe diuers ſtalkes that beare yellow flowers, and ſeede in pods, almoſt as ſmall as Muſtard ſeede: the roote is ſomewhat long, and very buſhie with threds.</p>

                     <p>The yellow and the red are more rare, and nourſed vp only by thoſe that are curious: as alſo the Navewe, which is ſeene but with very few.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="509" facs="tcp:15790:261"/>The ordinary Garden Turnep hath many large, and long rough greene leaues, with deepe and vneuen gaſhes on both ſides of them: the ſtalke riſeth vp among the leaues about two foote high, ſpread at the toppe into many branches, bearing theron yellow flowers, which turne into long pods, with blackiſh round ſeede in them: the roote is round and white, ſome greater, ſome ſmaller; the beſt kinde is knowne to be flat, with a ſmall pigges tale-like roote vnderneath it; the worſer kinde which is more common in many places of this land, both North and Weſt, is round, and not flat, with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pigges tayle-like roote vnderneath.</p>
                     <p>The yellow kinde doth often grow very great, it is hardly diſcerned from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary kinde while it groweth, but by the greatneſſe and ſpreading of the leaues beeing boyled, the roote changeth more yellow, ſomewhat neare the colour of a Carrot.</p>
                     <p>The red Turnep groweth vſually greater then any of the other, eſpecially in a good ground, being of a faire red colour on the outſide, but being pared, as white as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the inſide. This, as Matthiolus ſaith, doth grow in the Countrey of Anania, where hee hath ſeene an infinite number of them that haue waighed fifty pound a peece, and in ſome places hee ſaith, a hundred pound a peece, both which we would thinke to be incredible, but that we ſee the kind is greatly giuen to grow, and in warme Countries they may ſo thriue, that the bulke or bigneſſe of the roote may ſo farre paſſe the growth of our Countrey, as that it may riſe to that quantity aboue ſpecified.</p>
                     <p>The Navew gentle is of two kindes, a ſmaller and a greater; the ſmaller is vſually called in France, <hi>Navean de Cane,</hi> the roote is ſomewhat long with the roundneſſe; this kinde is twice as bigge as a mans thumbe, and many of them leſſe: The other is long and great, almoſt as big as the ſhort Carrot, but for the moſt part of an vneuen length, and roundneſſe vnto the very end, where it ſpreadeth into diuers ſmall long fibres: neyther of them doth differ much from the Turnep, in leafe, flower or ſeed.</p>

                     <p>THere are two principall kindes of Garden Raddiſh, the one is blackiſh on the outſide, and the otherwhite; and of both theſe there is ſome diuiſion againe, as ſhall be ſhewed. Dittander and horſe Raddiſh be reckoned kinds thereof.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary Raddiſh hath long leaues, vneuenly gaſhed on both ſides, the ſtalke ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vp to the height of three or foure foote, bearing many purpliſh flowers at the top, made of foure leaues a peece, which turne into thicke and ſhort pods, wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained round ſeede, greater then Turnep or Coleworte ſeede, and of a pale reddiſh colour: the roote is long, white, and of a reddiſh purple colour on the outſide toward the toppe of it, and of a ſharpe biting taſte.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſmall kind of Raddiſh that commeth earlier then the former, that we haue had out of the low Countries, not differing in any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>The blacke Raddiſh I haue had brought me out of the lowe Countries, where they ſell them in ſome places by the pound, and is accounted with them a rare winter ſallet: <pb n="510" facs="tcp:15790:262"/> the roote of the beſt kinde is blackiſh on the outſide (and yet the ſeede gathered from ſuch an one, hath after the ſowing againe, giuen rootes, whereof ſome haue beene blacke, but the moſt part white on the outſide) and white within, great and round at the head, almoſt like a Turnep, but ending ſhorter then a Raddiſh, and longer then a Turnep, almoſt peare-faſhion, of a firmer and harder ſubſtance then the ordinary Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, but no leſſe ſharpe and biting, and ſomewhat ſtrong withall; the leaues are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſmaller, and with deeper gaſhes, the flower and ſeede are like the former, but ſmaller.</p>
                     <p>Another ſort of blacke Raddiſh is like in leafe and ſeede to the former, but the flower is of a lighter purple colour: the roote is longer and ſmaller, and changeth alſo to bee white as the former doth, ſo that I thinke they haue both riſen from one kinde.</p>
                     <p>The Horſe Raddiſh is a kinde of wilde Raddiſh, but brought into Gardens for the vſe of it, and hath great large and long greene leaues, which are not ſo much diuided, but dented about the edges: the roote is long and great, much ſtronger in taſte then the former, and abideth diuers yeares, ſpreading with branches vnder ground.</p>
                     <p>Dittander is likewiſe a wilde kinde hereof, hauing long pointed blewiſh greene leaues, and a roote that creepeth much vnder ground: I confeſſe this might haue bin placed among the herbes, becauſe the leaues and not the rootes are vſed; but let it paſſe now with the kindes of Raddiſh.</p>

                        <head>The Vſe of theſe Raddiſhes.</head>
                        <p>Raddiſhes doe ſerue vſually as a <hi>ſtimulum</hi> before meat, giuing an appetite thereunto; the poore eate them alone with bread and ſalt. Some that are early ſowen, are eaten in Aprill, or ſooner if the ſeaſon permit; others come later; and ſome are ſowen late to ſerue for the end of Summer: but (as of all things elſe) the earlier are the more accepted.</p>
                        <p>The blacke Raddiſhes are moſt vſed in the winter, (yet ſome in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and not forc'd grounds, haue their rootes good moſt part of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) and therefore muſt bee ſowen after Midſomer; for if they ſhould bee ſowen earlier, they would preſently runne vp to ſtalke and ſeed, and ſo loſe the benefit of the roote. The Phyſicall propertie is, it is often vſed in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that helpe to breake the ſtone, and to auoyde grauell.</p>
                        <p>The Horſe Raddiſh is vſed Phyſically, very much in Melancholicke, Spleneticke and Scorbuticke diſeaſes. And ſome vſe to make a kinde of Muſtard with the rootes, and eate it with fiſh.</p>
                        <p>Dittander or Pepperworte is vſed of ſome cold churliſh ſtomackes, as a ſawce or ſallet ſometimes to their meate, but it is too hot, bitter and ſtrong for weake and tender ſtomackes.</p>
                        <p>Our Gardiners about London vſe great fences of reede tyed together, which ſeemeth to bee a mat ſet vpright, and is as good as a wall to defend the cold from thoſe things that would be defended, and to bring them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the earlier.</p>

                     <p>The white Onions both long and flat, are like vnto Chalke-ſtones lying vpon the ground, when they are ripe and fit to be gathered.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, there is the Spaniſh Onion, both long and flat, very ſweete, and eaten by many like an apple, but as Iohn Tradeſcante ſaith, who hath beene in Spaine, that the Spaniards themſelues doe not eate them ſo familiarly, as they doe thoſe white Onions that come out of our owne Countrey, which they haue there more plentifully then their ſweete Onions.</p>

                     <p>THere be likewiſe ſundry ſorts of Leekes, both great and ſmall. Leekes are very like vnto Onions, hauing long green hollow-like leaues, flattiſh on the one ſide, and with a ridge or creſt on the backe ſide: if they bee ſuffered to grow vncut, then in the ſecond or third yeare after the ſowing, they will ſend forth a round and ſlender ſtalke, euen quite thoroughout, and not ſwollen or bigger in the middle like the Onion, bearing at the toppe a head of purpliſh flowers, and blacke ſeede after them, very like vnto Onion ſeede, that it is hard to diſtinguiſh them: the root is long and white, with a great buſh of fibres hanging at it, which they call the beards.</p>
                     <p>The vnſet Leeke hath longer and ſlenderer roots then the other, which being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, groweth thicker and greater.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="513" facs="tcp:15790:263"/>The French Leeke, which is called the Vine Leeke, is the beſt of all others.</p>
                     <p>Our common kinde is of two ſorts, one greater then another.</p>
                     <p>Another ſort encreaſeth altogether by the roote, as Garlicke doth.</p>
                     <p>And then Ciues, which are the ſmalleſt, and encreaſe aboundantly only by the root.</p>
                     <p>Some doe account Scalions to be rather a kinde of Onions then Leekes, and call them <hi>Cepa Aſcalonica,</hi> or
<hi>Aſcalonitides,</hi> which will quickly ſpend it ſelfe, if it be ſuffered to be vncut; but all Authors affirme, that there is no wilde kinde of Onion, vnleſſe they would haue it to be <hi>Gethyum,</hi> whereof Theophraſtus maketh mention, ſaying, that it hath a long necke (and ſo theſe Scalions haue) and was alſo of ſome called <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyllides,</hi> which antiquity accounted to be dedicated to Latona, the mother of Apollo, becauſe when ſhe was bigge with childe of Apollo, ſhe longed for theſe Leekes.</p>

                        <head>The Vſe of Leekes.</head>
                        <p>The old World, as wee finde in Scripture, in the time of the children of Iſraels being in Egypt, and no doubt long before, fed much vpon Leekes, Onions, and Garlicke boyled with fleſh; and the antiquity of the Gentiles relate the ſame manner of feeding on them, to be in all Countries the like, which howſoeuer our dainty age now refuſeth wholly, in all ſorts except the pooreſt; yet Muſcouia and Ruſſia vſe them, and the Turkes to this day, (as Bellonius writeth) obſerue to haue them among their diſhes at their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yea although they be <hi>Baſhas, Cades,</hi> or
<hi>Vaiuodas,</hi> that is to ſay, Lords, Iudges, or Gouernours of countries and places. They are vſed with vs alſo ſometimes in Lent to make pottage, and is a great and generall feeding in Wales with the vulgar Gentlemen.</p>
                        <p>Onions boyled or roſted vnder the embers, and mixed with ſugar and butter, are good for thoſe that are troubled with coughes, ſhortneſſe of breath, and wheeſing. An Onion made hollow at the bottome, and ſome good Treakle put into it, with a little iuyce of Citrons (or Lemons in the ſtead thereof) being well baked together vnder the embers, after the hole is ſtopped againe, and then ſtrained forth, and giuen to one that hath the plague, is very helpefull, ſo as hee be laid to ſweate vpon it.</p>
                        <p>Ciues are vſed as well to be ſhred among other herbes for the pot, as to be put into a Sallet among other herbs, to giue it a quicker relliſh.</p>
                        <p>Leekes are held to free the cheſt and lungs from much corruption and rotten flegme, that ſticketh faſt therein, and hard to be auoided, as alſo for them that through hoarſeneſſe haue loſt their voice, if they be eyther taken rawe, or boyled with broth of barley, or ſome ſuch other ſupping, fit and conducing thereunto. And baked vnder hot embers is a remedy againſt a ſurfeit of Muſhromes.</p>
                        <p>The greene blades of Leekes being boyled and applyed warme to the <hi>Hemorrhoides</hi> or piles, when they are ſwolne and painfull, giue a great deale of caſe.</p>

                     <p>The white Artichoke is in all things like the red, but that the head is of a whitiſh aſhe colour, like the leaues, whereas the former is reddiſh.</p>
                     <p>We haue alſo another, whoſe head is greene, and very ſharpe vpwards, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in many places.</p>
                     <p>Wee haue had alſo another kinde in former times that grew as high as any man, and branched into diuers ſtalkes, euery one bearing a head thereon, almoſt as bigge as the firſt.</p>
                     <p>There is another kinde, called the Muske Artichoke, which groweth like the French kinde, but is much better in ſpending, although it haue a leſſer bottome.</p>
                     <p>The French Artichoke hath a white head, the ſcales whereof ſtand ſtaring far aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one from another at the ends, which are ſharpe: this is well known by this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that while it is hot after it is boyled, it ſwelleth ſo ſtrong, that one would verily thinke it had bin boyled in ſtinking water, which was brought ouer after a great froſte that had well nigh conſumed our beſt kindes, and are now almoſt cleane caſt out again, none being willing to haue it take vp the roome of better.</p>
                     <p>There is a lowe kinde that groweth much about Paris, which the French eſteeme more then any other, and is lower then the former French kinde, the head whereof as well as the leaues, is of a freſher greene colour, almoſt yellowiſh.</p>
                     <p>Then there is the Thiſtle Artichoke, which is almoſt a wilde kinde, and groweth ſmaller, with a more open and prickly head then any of the former.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, the Chardon as they call it, becauſe it is almoſt of the forme and nature of a Thiſtle, or wilde Artichoke. This groweth high, and full of ſharpe prickles, of a grayiſh colour. Iohn Tradeſcante aſſured mee, hee ſaw three acres of Land about Bruſſels planted with this kinde, which the owner whited like Endiue, and then ſold them in the winter: Wee cannot yet finde the true manner of dreſſing them, that our Countrey may take delight therein.</p>
                     <p>All theſe kindes are encreaſed by ſlipping the young ſhootes from the root, which being replanted in February, March, or Aprill, haue the ſame yeare many times, but the next at the moſt, borne good heads.</p>
                     <p>Wee finde by dayly experience, that our Engliſh red Artichoke is in our Countrey the moſt delicate meate of any of the other, and therefore diuers thinking it to bee a ſeuerall kinde, haue ſent them into Italie, France, and the Lowe Countries, where they haue not abode in their goodneſſe aboue two yeare, but that they haue degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; ſo that it ſeemeth, that our ſoyle and climate hath the preheminence to nouriſh vp this plant to his higheſt excellencie.</p>

                     <p>Our ordinary Beanes, ſeruing for foode for the poorer ſort for the moſt part, are planted as well in fieldes as in gardens, becauſe the quantity of them that are ſpent ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp many acres of land to be planted in, and riſe vp with one, two or three ſtalks, according to the fertilitie of the ſoyle, being ſmooth and ſquare, higher then any man oftentimes, whereon are ſet at certaine diſtances, from the very bottome almoſt to the toppe, two long ſmooth fleſhy and thicke leaues almoſt round, one ſtanding by another at the end of a ſmall footeſtalke: betweene theſe leaues and the ſtalke, come forth diuers flowers, all of them looking one way for the moſt part, which are cloſe a little turned vp at the brimmes, white and ſpotted with a blackiſh ſpot in the middle of them, and ſomwhat purpliſh at the foot or bottome, of the forme almoſt of Broome or Peaſe flowers, many of which that grow vpward toward the toppe, doe ſeldome beare fruit, and therefore are gathered to diſtill, and the toppes of the ſtalkes cut off, to cauſe the reſt to thriue the better; after which grow vp long great ſmooth greene pods, greater then in any other kinde of Pulſe, which grow blacke when they are ripe, and containe within them two, three or foure Beanes, which are ſomewhat flat and round, eyther white or reddiſh, which being full ripe grow blackiſh: the roote hath diuers fibres annexed vnto the maine roote, which dyeth euery yeare.</p>
                     <p>The French or Kidney Beane riſeth vp at the firſt but with one ſtalke, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diuideth it ſelfe into many armes or branches, euery one of them being ſo weak, that without they be ſuſtained with ſtickes or poles, whereon with their winding and claſpers they take hold, they would lye fruitleſſe vpon the ground: vpon theſe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches grow forth at ſeuerall places long footeſtalkes, with euery of them three broade, round and pointed greene leaues at the end of them, towards the tops whereof come forth diuers flowers, made like vnto Peaſe bloſſomes, of the ſame colour for the moſt part that the fruit will be of, that is to ſay, eyther white, or yellow, or red, or blackiſh, or of a deepe purple &amp;c. but white is moſt vſuall for our Garden; after which come long and ſlender flat pods, ſome crooked, and ſome ſtraight, with a ſtring as it were running downe the backe thereof, wherein are contained flattiſh round fruit, made to the faſhion of a kidney: the roote is long, and ſpreadeth with many fibres annexed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, periſhing euery yeare.</p>

The water of the bloſſomes diſtilled, is vſed to take away ſpots, and to cleer the skin. The water of the greene huskes or cods is good for the ſtone.</p>

                     <p>OF Cowcumbers there are diuers ſorts, differing chiefly in the forme and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the fruit, and not in the forme of the plant; therefore one deſcription ſhall ſerue in ſtead of all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The Cowcumber bringeth forth many trailing rough greene branches lying on the ground, all along whereof growe ſeuerall leaues, which are rough, broad, vneuen at the edges, and pointed at the ends, with long crooked tendrels comming forth at the ſame ioynt with the leafe, but on the other ſide therof: between the ſtalks &amp; the leaues at the ioynts come forth the flowers ſeuerally, euery one ſtanding on a ſhort foot-ſtalke, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it ſelfe into fiue leaues, of a yellowiſh colour, at the bottome whereof groweth the fruit, long and greene at the firſt, but when it is thorough ripe, a little yellowiſh, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many furrowes, and vneuen bunches all the length of it, wherein is a white firme ſubſtance next vnto the skin, and a cleare pulpe or watery ſubſtance, with white flat ſeede lying diſperſed through it: the roote is long and white, with diuers fibres at it.</p>

                        <p>The firſt deſcribed is called, The long greene Cowcumber.</p>
                        <p>There is another is called, The ſhort Cowcumber, being ſhort, and of an equall bigneſſe in the body thereof, and of an vnequall bigneſſe at both ends.</p>
                        <p>The long Yellow, which is yellowiſh from the beginning, and more yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low when it is ripe, and hath beene meaſured to be thirteene inches long: but this is not that ſmall long Cowcumber, called of the Latines, <hi>Cucumis anguinus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another kinde is early ripe, called The French kinde.</p>
                        <p>The Dantſicke kinde beareth but ſmall fruit, growing on ſhort branches or runners: the pickled Cowcumbers that are vſually ſold are of this kind.</p>

                        <p>Some vſe to caſt a little ſalt on their ſliced Cowcumbers, and let them ſtand halfe an houre or more in a diſh, and then poure away the water that commeth from them by the ſalt, and after put vinegar, oyle, &amp;c. thereon, as euery one liketh: this is done, to take away the ouermuch wateriſhneſſe and coldneſſe of the Cowcumbers.</p>
                        <p>In many countries they vſe to eate Cowcumbers as wee doe Apples or Peares, paring and giuing ſlices of them, as we would to our friends of ſome dainty Apple or Peare.</p>
                        <p>The pickled Cowcumbers that come from beyond Sea, are much vſed <pb n="525" facs="tcp:15790:269"/> with vs for ſawce to meate all the Winter long. Some haue ſtriuen to equall them, by pickling vp our Cowcumbers at the later end of the yeare, when they are cheapeſt, taking the little ones and ſcalding them thoroughly well, which after they put in brine, with ſome Dill or Fenell leaues and ſtalkes: but theſe are nothing comparable to the former, wee either miſſing of the right and orderly pickling of them, or the kinde it ſelfe differing much from ours (as I ſaid of the Dantſicke kinde) for ours are neither ſo tender and firme, nor ſo ſauoury as the other.</p>

                     <p>THere bee diuers ſorts of Melons found out at this day, differing much in the goodneſſe of taſte one from another. This Countrey hath not had vntill of late yeares the skill to nourſe them vp kindly, but now there are many that are ſo well experienced therein, and haue their ground ſo well prepared, as that they will not miſſe any yeare, if it be not too extreme vnkindly, to haue many ripe ones in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time: yet ſome will be later then others alwayes.</p>
                     <p>The Melon is certainly a kinde of Cowcumber, it doth ſo neare reſemble it, both in the manner of his growing, hauing rough trailing branches, rough vneuen leaues, and yellow flowers: after which come the fruit, which is rounder, thicker, bigger, more rugged, and ſpotted on the outſide then the Cowcumber, of a ruſſet colour, and greene vnderneath, which when it groweth full ripe, will change a little yellowiſh, being as deepe furrowed and ribbed as they, and beſides hauing chaps or rifts in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of the rinde: the inward hard ſubſtance is yellow, which onely is eaten: the ſeede which is bigger, and a little yellower then the Cowcumber, lying in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle onely among the moiſter pulpe: the ſmell and changing of his colour, fore-ſhew their ripeneſſe to them that are experienced: the roote is long, with many fibres at it. The fruit requireth much watering in the hot time of the day, to cauſe them to ripen the ſooner, as I haue obſerued by diuers of the beſt skill therein.</p>

                        <p>Some are called Sugar Melons, others Peare Melons, and others Muske Melons.</p>
                        <p>They haue beene formerly only eaten by great perſonages, becauſe the fruit was not only delicate but rare; and therfore diuers were brought from France, and ſince were nourſed vp by the Kings or Noblemens Gardiners onely, to ſerue for their Maſters delight: but now diuers others that haue skill and conueniencie of ground for them, doe plant them and make them more common.</p>
                        <p>They paire away the outer rinde, and cut out the inward pulpe where the ſeede lyeth, ſlice the yellow firme inward rinde or ſubſtance, &amp; ſo eate it with ſalt and pepper (and good ſtore of wine, or elſe it will hardly diſgeſt) for this is firmer, &amp; hath not that moiſture in it that the Cowcumbers haue.

                     <p>The greene Strawberry likewiſe differeth not, but that the fruit is green on all ſides when it is ripe, ſaue on that ſide the Sun lyeth vpon it, and there it is ſomewhat red.</p>
                     <p>The Virginia Strawberry carryeth the greateſt leafe of any other, except the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian, but ſcarce can one Strawberry be ſeene ripe among a number of plants; I thinke the reaſon thereof to be the want of skill, or induſtry to order it aright. For the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, and all other Strawberries will not beare kindly, if you ſuffer them to grow with many ſtrings, and therefore they are ſtill cut away.</p>
                     <p>There is another very like vnto this, that Iohn Tradeſcante brought with him from Bruſſels long agoe, and in ſeuen yeares could neuer ſee one berry ripe on all ſides, but ſtill the better part rotten, although it would euery yeare flower abundantly, and beare very large leaues.</p>
                     <p>The Bohemia Strawberry hath beene with vs but of late dayes, but is the goodlieſt and greateſt, both for leafe next to the Virginian, and for beauty farre ſurpaſſing all; for ſome of the berries haue beene meaſured to bee neere fiue inches about. Maſter Queſter the Poſtmaſter firſt brought them ouer into our Country, as I vnderſtand, but I know no man ſo induſtrious in the carefull planting and bringing them to perfection in that plentifull maner, as Maſter Vincent Sion who dwelt on the Banck ſide, neer the old Paris garden ſtaires, who from ſeuen rootes, as hee affirmed to me, in one yeare and a halfe, planted halfe an acree of ground with the increaſe from them, beſides thoſe he gaue away to his friends, and with him I haue ſeene ſuch, and of that bigneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>

It is in leafe much like vnto the ordinary, but differeth in that the flower, if it haue any, is greene, or rather it beareth a ſmall head of greene leaues, many ſet thicke together like vnto a double ruffe, in the midſt whereof ſtandeth the fruit, which when it is ripe, ſheweth to be ſoft and ſomwhat reddiſh, like vnto a Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, but with many ſmall harmleſſe prickles on them, which may be eaten and chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mouth without any maner of offence, and is ſomewhat pleaſant like a Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry: it is no great bearer, but thoſe it doth beare, are ſet at the toppes of the ſtalks cloſe together, pleaſant to behold, and fit for a Gentlewoman to weare on her arme, &amp;c. as a raritie in ſtead of a flower.</p>

                        <p>The berries themſelues are often brought to the Table as a reare ſeruice, whereunto claret wine, creame or milke is added with ſugar, as euery one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; as alſo at other times, both with the better and meaner ſort, and are a good cooling and pleaſant diſh in the hot Summer ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>The water diſtilled of the berries, is good for the paſſions of the heart, cauſed by the perturbation of the ſpirits, being eyther drunke alone, or in wine; and maketh the heart merry.</p>

The green ſtalkes or the young rootes being preſerued or candied, are very effectuall to comfort and warme a colde and weake ſtomacke: and in the time of infection is of excellent good vſe to preſerue the ſpirits and heart from infection. The dryed roote made into pouder, and taken in wine or other drinke, will abate the rage of luſt in young perſons, as I haue it related vnto me vpon credit: A Syrupe made thereof in this manner, is very profitable to expectorate flegme out of the cheſt and lunges, and to procure a ſweete breath. Into the greene ſtalke of Angelica as it ſtandeth growing, make a great gaſhe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, wherein put a quantitie of fine white Sugar, letting it there abide for three dayes, and after take it forth by cutting a hole at the next ioynt vnder the cut, where the Syrupe reſteth, or cut off the ſtalke, and turne it downe, that the Syrupe may drayne forth; which keepe for a moſt delicate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I haue done in the two former parts of this Treatiſe, ſo I meane to proceede in this; firſt to ſet downe the ſituation of an Orchard, and then other things in order: And firſt, I hold that an Orchard which is, or ſhould bee of ſome reaſonable large extent, ſhould be ſo placed, that the houſe ſhould haue the Garden of flowers iuſt before it open vpon the South, and the Kitchen Garden on the one ſide thereof, ſhould alſo haue the Orchard on the other ſide of the Garden of Pleaſure, for many good reaſons: Firſt, for that the fruit trees being grown great and tall, will be a great ſhelter from the North and Eaſt windes, which may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your chiefeſt Garden, and although that your Orchard ſtand a little bleake vpon the windes, yet trees rather endure theſe ſtrong bitter blaſts, then other ſmaller and more tender ſhrubs and herbes can doe. Secondly, if your Orchard ſhould ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde your Garden of flowers more Southward, it would ſhadow too much of the Garden, and beſides, would ſo binde in the North and Eaſt, and North and Weſt windes vpon the Garden, that it would ſpoile many tender things therein, and ſo much abate the edge of your pleaſure thereof, that you would willingly wiſh to haue no Orchard, rather then that it ſhould ſo much annoy you by the ſo ill ſtanding thereof. Thirdly, the falling leaues being ſtill blowne with the winde ſo aboundantly into the Garden, would either ſpoile many things, or haue one daily and continuall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereon, to cleanſe and ſweepe them away. Or elſe to auoide theſe great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, appoint out an Orchard the farther off, and ſet a greater diſtance of ground betweene. For the ground or ſoile of the Orchard, what I haue ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former Garden for the bettering of the ſeuerall grounds, may very well ſerue and be applyed to this purpoſe. But obſerue this, that whereas your Gardens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of may be turned vp, manured, and bettered with ſoile if they growe out of heart, your Orchard is not ſo eaſily done, but muſt abide many yeares without alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and therefore if the ground be barren, or not good, it had the more neede to bee amended, or wholly made good, before you make an Orchard of it; yet ſome there be <pb n="536" facs="tcp:15790:275"/> that doe appoint, that where euery tree ſhould bee ſet, you onely digge that place to make it good: but you muſt know, that the rootes of trees runne further after a little times ſtanding, then the firſt compaſſe they are ſet in; and therefore a little compaſſe of ground can maintaine them but a little while, and that when the rootes are runne beyond that ſmall compaſſe wherein they were firſt ſet, and that they are come to the barren or bad ground, they can thriue no better then if they had beene ſet in that ground at the firſt, and if you ſhould afterwards digge beyond that compaſſe, intending to make the ground better further off, you ſhould much hurt the ſpreading rootes, and put your trees in danger: the ſituation of hils in many places is grauelly or chalky, which is not good for trees, becauſe they are both too ſtonie, and lacke mellow earth, wherein a tree doth moſt ioy and proſper, and want moiſture alſo (which is the life of all trees) becauſe of the quicke deſcent of raine to the lower grounds: and beſides all theſe inconueniences there is one more; your trees planted either on hils or hill ſides, are more ſubiect to the fury and force of windes to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, then thoſe that growe in the lower grounds; for the ſtrongeſt and moſt forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble windes come not vſually out of the North Eaſt parts, where you prouide beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but from the South and Weſt, whence you looke for the beſt comfort of the Sunne. To helpe therefore manie of the inconueniences of the hils ſides, it were fit to cauſe manie leauels to bee made thereon, by raiſing the lower grounds with good earth, and ſuſtaining them with bricke or ſtone wals, which although chargeable, will counteruaile your coſt, beſide the pleaſure of the walkes, and proſpect of ſo worthy a worke. The plaine or leuell grounds as they are the moſt frequent, ſo they are the moſt commendable for an Orchard, becauſe the moulds or earths are more rich, or may better and ſooner be made ſo; and therefore the profits are the more may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from them. A ſtiffe clay doth nouriſh trees well, by reaſon it containeth moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; but in regard of the coldneſſe thereof, it killeth for the moſt part all tender and early things therein: ſea-cole aſhes therefore, bucke aſhes, ſtreete ſoyle, chaulke after it hath lyen abroad and been broken with many yeares froſts and raine, and ſheepes dung, are the moſt proper and fitteſt manure to helpe this kinde of ſoyle. The dry ſandy ſoile, and grauelly ground are on the contrary ſide as bad, by reaſon of too much heate and lacke of moiſture: the dung of kine or cattell in good quantity beſtowed thereon, will much helpe them. The amending or bettering of other ſorts of grounds is ſet down toward the end of the firſt Chapter of the firſt part of this worke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I will referre you, not willing to repeate againe the ſame things there ſet downe. The beſt way to auoide and amend the inconueniences of high, boiſterous, and cold windes, is to plant Walnut trees, Elmes, Oakes or Aſhes, a good diſtance without the compaſſe of your Orchard, which after they are growne great, will bee a great ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard thereunto, by breaking the violence of the windes from it. And if the ſoyle of your Orchard want moiſture, the conueying of the ſinke of the houſe, as alſo any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draine of water thereinto, if it may be, will much helpe it.</p>

                  <p>ACcording to the ſituation of mens grounds, ſo muſt the plantation of them of neceſſitie be alſo; and if the ground be in forme, you ſhall haue a formall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard: if otherwiſe, it can haue little grace or forme. And indeed in the elder ages there was ſmall care or heede taken for the formality; for euery tree for the moſt part was planted without order, euen where the maſter or keeper found a vacant place to plant them in, ſo that oftentimes the ill placing of trees without ſufficient ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and negligence in not looking to vphold them, procured more waſte and ſpoile of fruit, then any accident of winde or weather could doe. Orchards in moſt places haue not bricke or ſtone wals to ſecure them, becauſe the extent thereof being <pb n="537" facs="tcp:15790:275"/> larger then of a Garden, would require more coſt, which euery one cannot vndergoe; and therefore mud wals, or at the beſt a quicke ſet hedge, is the ordinary and moſt vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all defence it findeth almoſt in all places: but with thoſe that are of ability to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe it with bricke or ſtone wals, the gaining of ground, and profit of the fruit trees planted there againſt, will in ſhort time recompenſe that charge. If you make a doubt how to be ſure that your Orchard wall ſhall haue ſufficient comfort of the Sunne to ripen the fruits, in regard the trees in the Orchard being ſo nigh thereunto, and ſo high withall, will ſo much ſhadow the wall, that nothing will ripen well, becauſe it will want the comfort of the Sunne: you may follow this rule and aduice, to remedy thoſe inconueniences. Hauing an Orchard containing one acre of ground, two, three, or more, or leſſe, walled about, you may ſo order it, by leauing a broad and large walke betweene the wall and it, containing twenty or twenty foure foote (or yards if you will) that the wall ſhall not be hindered of the Sun, but haue ſufficient comfort for your trees, notwithſtanding the height of them, the diſtance betweene them and the wall being a ſufficient ſpace for their ſhadow to fall into: and by compaſſing your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard on the inſide with a hedge

For the placing of your trees in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, firſt for the wals: Thoſe ſides that lye open to the South &amp; Southweſt Sunne, are fitteſt to bee planted with your tendereſt and earlieſt fruits, as Apricockes, Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Nectarius, and May or early Cherries: the Eaſt, North and Weſt, for Plums and Quinces, as you ſhall like beſt to place them. And for the Orchard it ſelfe, the ordinary manner is to place them without regard of meaſure or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as Peares among Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Plums among Cherries promiſcuouſly; but ſome keepe both a diſtance and a diuiſion for euery ſort, without intermingling: yet the moſt gracefull Orchard containeth them all, with ſome others, ſo as they be placed that one doe not hinder or ſpoile another; and therefore to deſcribe you the modell of an Orchard, both rare for comelineſſe in the proportion, and pleaſing for the profitableneſſe in the vſe, and alſo durable for continuance, regard this figure is here placed for your direction, where you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that your trees are here ſet in ſuch an equall diſtance one from another euery way, &amp; as is fitteſt for them, that when they are grown great, the greater branches ſhall not gall or rubbe one againſt another; for which purpoſe twenty or ſixteene foot is the leaſt to be allowed for the diſtance euery way of your trees, &amp; being ſet in rowes euery one in the middle diſtance, will be the moſt gracefull for the plantation, and beſides, giue you way ſufficient to paſſe through them, to pruine, loppe, or dreſſe them, as need ſhall require, and may alſo bee brought (if you pleaſe) to that gracefull delight, that euery alley or diſtance may be formed like an arch, the branches of either ſide meeting to be enterlaced together. Now for the ſeuerall ſorts of fruit trees that you ſhall place in this modell, your beſt direction is to ſet Damſons, Bulleis, and your taler growing Plums on the outſide, and your lower Plums, Cherries, and Apples on the inſide, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard, that you place no Peare tree to the Sunward, of any other tree, leſt it ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:15790:276"/> them: Let your Peare trees therefore be placed behinde, or on the one ſide of your lower trees, that they may be as it were a ſhelter or defence on the North &amp; Eaſt ſide. Thus may you alſo plant Apples among Plums and Cherries, ſo as you ſuffer not one to ouer-growe or ouer-toppe another; for by pruning, lopping, and ſhred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe that growe too faſt for their fellowes, you may ſtill keepe your trees in ſuch a conformity, as may be both moſt comely for the ſight, and moſt profitable for the yeelding of greater and better ſtore of fruit. Other ſorts of fruit trees you may mixe among theſe, if you pleaſe, as Filberds, Cornellian Cherries in ſtanderds, and Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: but Seruice trees, Baye trees, and others of that high ſort, muſt be ſet to guard the reſt. Thus haue I giuen you the faireſt forme could as yet be deuiſed; and from this patterne, if you doe not follow it preciſely, yet by it you may proportion your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, be it large or little, be it walled or hedged.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of a nourſery for trees, both from ſowing the kernels, and planting fit ſtockes to graft vpon.</head>
                  <p>ALthough I know the greater ſort (I meane the Nobility and better part of the Gentrie of this Land) doe not intend to keepe a Nurſery, to raiſe vp thoſe trees that they meane to plant their wals or Orchards withall, but to buy them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready grafted to their hands of them that make their liuing of it: yet becauſe many Gentlemen and others are much delighted to beſtowe their paines in grafting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and eſteeme their owne labours and handie worke farre aboue other mens: for their incouragement and ſatisfaction, I will here ſet downe ſome conuenient directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to enable them to raiſe an Orchard of all ſorts of fruits quickly, both by ſowing the kernels or ſtones of fruit, and by making choiſe of the beſt ſorts of ſtockes to graft on: Firſt therefore to begin with Cherries; If you will make a Nurſery, wherein you may bee ſtored with plenty of ſtockes in a little ſpace, take what quantitie you thinke good of ordinarie wilde blacke Cherrie ſtones, cleanſed from the berries, and ſowe them, or pricke them in one by one on a peece of ground well turned vp, and large enough for the quantitie of ſtones you will beſtowe thereon, from the midſt of Auguſt vnto the end of September, which when they are two or three yeares old, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their growth, you may remoue them, and ſet them anew in ſome orderly rowes, hauing pruned their tops and their rootes, which at the next yeares growth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the new planting in any good ground, or at the ſecond, will be of ſufficient big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to graft vpon in the bud what ſorts of Cherries you thinke beſt: and it is fitteſt to graft them thus young, that pruning your ſtockes to raiſe them high, you may graft them at fiue or ſix foote high, or higher, or lower, as you ſhall ſee good, and being thus grafted in the bud, will both more ſpeedily and ſafely bring forward your grafts, and with leſſe danger of loſing your ſtockes, then by grafting them in the ſtocke: for if the bud take not by inoculating the firſt yeare, yet your tree is not loſt, nor put in any hazzard of loſſe; but may be grafted anew the yeare following, if you will, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place thereof, whereas if you graft in the ſtocke, and it doe not take, it is a great chance if the ſtocke dye not wholly, or at leaſt be not ſo weakened both in ſtrength and height, that it will not bee fit to bee grafted a yeare or two after. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as you doe with the blacke, you may deale with the ordinary Engliſh red Cherrie ſtones, or kernels, but they are not ſo apt to growe ſo ſtraight and high, nor in ſo ſhort a time as the blacke Cherrie ſtones are, and beſides are ſubiect in time to bring out ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers from the rootes, to the hinderance of the ſtockes and grafts, or at the leaſt to the deformitie of your Orchard, and more trouble to the Gardiner, to pull or digge them away. Plumme ſtones may bee ordered in this manner likewiſe, but you muſt make choiſe of your Plums; for although euery Plumme is not ſo fit for this purpoſe, as the white Peare Plumme, becauſe it groweth the goaleſt and freeſt, the barke being ſmooth and apteſt to be raiſed, that they may be grafted vpon; yet diuers other Plummes may be taken, if they be not at hand, or to be had, as the blacke and red Peare Plumme, the <pb n="539" facs="tcp:15790:276"/> white and red Wheate Plumme, becauſe they are neareſt in goodneſſe vnto it. Peach ſtones will be ſoone raiſed vp to graft other ſorts of Peaches or Nectorins vpon, but the nature of the Peach roote being ſpongie, is not to abide long. As for Almonds, they will be raiſed from their ſtones to be trees of themſelues; but they will hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the remouing, and leſſe to bee grafted vpon. Apricocke ſtones are the worſt to deale withall of any ſort of ſtone fruit; for although the Apricocke branches are the fitteſt ſtockes to graft Nectorins of the beſt ſorts vpon, yet thoſe that are raiſed from the kernels or ſtones will neuer thriue to be brought on for this purpoſe; but will ſtarue and dye, or hardly grow in a long time to be a ſtraight and fit ſtocke to be grafted, if it be once remoued. Your Cornellian Cherrie trees are wholly, or for the moſt part rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the ſtones or kernels; yet I know diuers doe increaſe them, by laying in their loweſt branches to take roote: and thus much for ſtone fruits. Now for Apples and Peares, to be dealt withall in the ſame manner as aforeſaid. They vſe to take the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Crabs whereas Veriuyce is made, as alſo of Cidar and Perry where they are made, and ſowing them, doe raiſe vp great ſtore of ſtockes; for although the beating of the fruit doth ſpoile many kernels, yet there will bee enough left that were neuer toucht, and that will ſpring: the Crabbe ſtockes ſome preferre for the fitteſt, but I am ſure, that the better Apple and Peare kernels will growe fairer, ſtraighter, quicklier, and better to be grafted on. You muſt remember, that after two or three yeares you take vp theſe ſtockes, and when you haue pruned both toppe and roote, to ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in a thinner and fitter order, to be afterwards grafted in the bud while they are young, as I ſhall ſhew you by and by, or in the ſtocke if you will ſuffer them to growe greater. Now likewiſe to know which are the fitteſt ſtockes of all ſorts to chooſe, thereon to graft euery of theſe ſorts of fruits, is a point of ſome skill indeede; and therefore obſerue them as I doe here ſet them downe: for bee you aſſured, that they are certaine rules, and knowne experiences, whereunto you may truſt without being deceiued. Your blacke Cherrie ſtockes (as I ſaid before) are the fitteſt and beſt for all ſorts of Cherries long to abide and proſper, and euen May or early Cherry will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide or liue longer, being grafted thereon, either in the budde or in the ſtocke, then on the ordinary red Cherry ſtocke; but the red Cherry ſtocke is in a manner the onely tree that moſt Nurſery men doe take to graft May Cherries on in the ſtocke (for it is but a late experience of many, to graft May Cherries in the bud) many alſo doe graft May Cherries on Gaſcoigne Cherry ſtockes, which doe not onely thrine well, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure longer then vpon any ordinay Cherry ſtocke: For indeede the May Cherries that are grafted vpon ordinary red Cherrie ſtockes, will hardly hold aboue a dozen yeares bearing well, although they come forwarder at the firſt, that is, doe beare ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then thoſe that are grafted on Gaſcoigne or blacke Cherry ſtockes; but as they are earlier in bearing, ſo they are ſooner ſpent, and the Gaſcoigne and blacke Cherry ſtockes that are longer in comming forward, will laſt twice or thrice their time; but many more grafts will miſſe in grafting of theſe, then of thoſe red Cherry ſtockes, and beſides, the natures of the Gaſcoigne and blacke Cherry ſtockes are to riſe higher, and make a goodlier tree then the ordinary red ſtocke will, which for the moſt part ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth wide, but riſeth not very high. The Engliſh red Cherry ſtocke will ſerue very well to graft any other ſort of Cherry vpon, and is vſed in moſt places of this Land, and I know no other greater inconuenience in it, then that it ſhooteth out many ſuckers from the roote, which yet by looking vnto may ſoone bee remoued from doing any harme, and that it will not laſt ſo long as the Gaſcoigne or blacke Cherry ſtocke will. May Cherries thus grafted lowe, doe moſt vſually ſerue to be planted againſt a wall, to bring on the fruit the earlier; yet ſome graft them high vpon ſtandards, although not many, and it is, I thinke, rather curioſity (if they that doe it haue any wals) then anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter that cauſeth them thus to doe: for the fruit is naturally ſmall, though early, and the ſtandard Cherries are alwaies later then the wall Cherries, ſo that if they can ſpare any roome for them at their wals, they will not plant many in ſtandards. Now concerning Plummes (as I ſaid before) for the ſowing or ſetting of the ſtones, ſo I ſay here for their choiſe in grafting of them, either in the budde or ſtocke. The white Peare Plumme ſtocke, and the other there mentioned, but eſpecially the white Peare Plumme is the goodlieſt, freeſt, and fitteſt of all the reſt, as well to graft all ſort of Plummes vpon, as alſo to graft Apricockes, which can be handſomely, and to any <pb n="540" facs="tcp:15790:277"/> good purpoſe grafted vpon no other Plum ſtocke, to riſe to bee worth the labour and paine. All ſorts of Plums may be grafted in the ſtocke, and ſo may they alſo in the bud; for I know none of them that will refuſe to be grafted in the bud, if a cunning hand performe it well; that is, to take off your bud cleanely and well, when you haue made choice of a fit cyon: for, as I ſhal ſhew you anon, it is no ſmall peece of cunning to chuſe your cyon that it may yeeld fit buds to graft withall, for euery plum is not of a like apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to yeeld them: But Apricocks cannot be grafted in the ſtock for any thing that euer I could heare or learne, but only in the bud, and therefore let your Plum ſtocke bee of a reaſonable ſize for Apricockes eſpecially, and not too ſmall, that the graft ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow not the ſtocke, and that the ſtocke bee large enough to nouriſh the graft. As your Plum ſtockes ſerue to graft both Apricockes and Plummes, ſo doe they ſerue alſo very well to graft Peaches of all ſorts; and although Peach ſtockes will ſerue to be grafted with Peaches againe, yet the Peach ſtocke (as I ſaid before) will not endure ſo long as the Plumme ſtocke, and therefore ſerueth but for neceſſity if Plum ſtocks be not ready, or at hand, or for the preſent time, or that they afterwards may graft that ſort of Peach on a Plumme ſtocke: for many might loſe a good fruit, if when they meete with it, and haue not Plumme ſtockes ready to graft it on, they could not be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that it would take vpon another Peach ſtocke or branch, or on the branch of an Apricocke eyther. Plumme ſtockes will ſerue likewiſe very well for ſome ſorts of Nectorins; I ſay, for ſome ſorts, and not for all: the greene and the yellow Necto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin will beſt thriue to be grafted immediately on a Plumme ſtocke; but the other two ſorts of red Nectorins muſt not be immediately grafted on the Plumme ſtocke, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a branch of an Apricocke that hath beene formerly grafted on a Plumme ſtocke, the nature of theſe Nectorins being found by experience to be ſo contrary to the Plum ſtocke, that it will ſterue it, and both dye within a yeare, two or three at the moſt: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue tryed to graft theſe red Nectorins vpon Peach ſtockes, and they haue endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red well a while; but ſeeing the Peach ſtocke will not laſt long it ſelfe, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weake, how can it hold ſo ſtrong a nature as theſe red Nectorins, which will (as I ſaid before) ſterue a Plum ſtocke that is ſufficient durable for any other Plumme?</p>
                  <p>Apricocke ſtockes from the ſtones are hardly nurſed vp, and worſe to be remoued, and if a red Nectorin ſhould be grafted on an Apricock rayſed from the ſtone, and not remoued, I doubt it might happen with it as it doth with many other trees raiſed from ſtones or kernels, and not remoued, that they would hardly beare fruit: for the nature of moſt trees raiſed from ſtones or kernels, and not remoued, is to ſend great downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right rootes, and not to ſpread many forwards; ſo that if they be not cut away that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may ſpreade abroad, I haue ſeldome ſeene or known any of them to beare in any reaſonable time; and therefore in remouing, theſe great downe-right rootes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſhred away, and thereby made fit to ſhoote others forwards. Hereby you may perceiue, that theſe red Nectorins will not abide to bee grafted vpon any other ſtocke well, then vpon an Apricocke branch, although the green and the yellow (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) will well endure and thriue vpon Plums. The ſuckers or ſhootes both of Plums and Cherries that riſe from their rootes, eyther neare their ſtockes, or farther off, ſo that they bee taken with ſome ſmall rootes to them, will ſerue to bee ſtockes, and will come forward quickly; but if the ſuckers haue no ſmall roots whereby they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in the ground, it is almoſt impoſſible it ſhould hold or abide. There is another way to rayſe vp eyther ſtockes to graft on, or trees without grafting, which is, by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing a faire and fit branch in this manner: About Midſomer, when the ſappe is thoroughly riſen (or before if the yeare be forward) they vſe to binde a good quantity of clay round about a faire and ſtraight branch, of a reaſonable good ſize or bigneſſe, with ſome conuenient bands, whether it be ropes of hey, or of any other thing, about an handfull aboue the ioynt, where the branch ſpreadeth from the tree, and cutting the barke thereof round about vnder the place where the clay is bound, the ſap is hereby hindered from riſing, or deſcending further then that place ſo circumciſed, whereby it will ſhoote out ſmall knubs and rootes into the clay, which they ſuffer ſo to abide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the beginning of winter, whenas with a fine Sawe they cut off that branch where it was circumciſed, and afterwardes place it in the ground where they would haue it to grow, and ſtake it, and binde it faſt, which will ſhoote forth rootes, and will become eyther a faire tree to beare fruite without grafting, or elſe a fit ſtocke to graft on accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <pb n="541" facs="tcp:15790:277"/> to the kinde: but oftentimes this kinde of propagation miſſeth, in that it ſendeth not forth rootes ſufficient to cauſe it to abide any long time. Let me yet before I leaue this narration of Plummes, giue you one admonition more, that vpon whatſoeuer Plumme ſtocke you doe graft, yet vpon a Damſon ſtocke that you neuer ſtriue to graft, for it (aboue all other ſorts of Plumme ſtockes) will neuer giue you a tree worth your labour. It remaineth only of ſtone fruit, that I ſpeake of Cornelles, which as yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſaw grafted vpon any ſtocke, being as it ſhould ſeeme vtterly repugnant to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, to abide grafting, but is wholly rayſed vp (as I ſaid before) eyther from the ſtones, or from the ſuckers or layers. For Peares and Apples your vſuall ſtockes to graft on are (as I ſaid before, ſpeaking of the nurſing vp of trees from the kernels) your Crabbe ſtockes, and they bee accepted in euery Countrey of this Land as they may conueniently be had, yet many doe take the ſtockes of better fruit, whether they bee ſuckers, or ſtockes rayſed from the kernels (and the moſt common and knowne way of grafting, is in the ſtocke for all ſorts of them, although ſome doe vſe whipping, packing on, or inciſing, as euery one liſt to call it: but now we doe in many places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to deale with Peares and Apples as with other ſtone fruit, that is, graft them all in the bud, which is found the moſt compendious and ſafeſt way both to preſerue your ſtocke from periſhing, and to bring them the ſooner to couer the ſtock, as alſo to make the goodlier and ſtraighter tree, being grafted at what height you pleaſe:) for thoſe ſtockes that are rayſed from the kernels of good fruit (which are for the moſt part ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily knowne from others, in that they want thoſe thornes or prickles the wilde kindes are armed withall:) I ſay for the moſt part; for I know that the kernels of ſome good fruite hath giuen ſtockes with prickles on them (which, as I thinke, was becauſe that good fruite was taken from a wilde ſtocke that had not beene long enough grafted to alter his wilde nature; for the longer a tree is grafted, the more ſtrength the fruite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from the graft, and the leſſe ſtill from the ſtocke) being ſmoother and fairer then the wilde kinds, muſt needes make a goodlier tree, and will not alter any whit the taſte of your fruit that is grafted thereon, but rather adde ſome better relliſh thereunto; for the Crabbe ſtockes yeelding harſh fruite, muſt giue part of their nature to the grafts are ſet thereon, and therefore the taſte or relliſh, as well as ſome other naturall properties of moſt fruits, are ſomewhat altered by the ſtocke. Another thing I would willingly giue you to vnderſtand concerning your fruits and ſtockes, that whereas diuers for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and to try experiments haue grafted Cherries vpon Plumme ſtockes, or Plums on Cherry ſtockes, Apples vpon Peare ſtockes, and Peares vpon Apple ſtockes, ſome of theſe haue held the graft a yeare, two or three peraduenture, but I neuer knew that euer they held long, or to beare fruite, much leſſe to abide or doe well: beſtow not therefore your paines and time on ſuch contrary natures, vnleſſe it be for curioſitie, as others haue done: Yet I know that they that graft peares on a white thorne ſtocke haue had their grafts ſeeme to thriue well, and continue long, but I haue ſeldome ſeene the fruite thereof anſwerable to the naturall wilde Peare ſtocke; yet the Medlar is knowne to thriue beſt on a white thorne. And laſtly, whereas diuers doe affirme that they may haue not only good ſtockes to graft vpon, but alſo faire trees to bear ſtore of fruit from the kernels of Peares or Apples being prickt into the ground, and ſuffered to grow without remouing, and then eyther grafted or ſuffered to grow into great trees vngrafted; and for their bearing of fruite, aſſigne a dozen or twenty yeares from the firſt ſetting of the kernels, and abiding vngrafted, I haue not ſeene or heard that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to hold certaine, or if it ſhould be ſo, yet it is too long time loſt, and too much fruit alſo, to waite twenty yeares for that profit may be gained in a great deale of leſſe time, and with more certainty. Vnto theſe inſtructions let mee adde alſo one more, which is not much known and vſed, and that is, to haue fruit within foure or fiue years from the firſt ſowing of your ſtones or kernels in this manner: After your ſtones or kernels are two or three yeares old, take the faireſt toppe or branch, and graft it as you would doe any other cyon taken from a bearing tree, and looke what rare fruite, eyther Peare or Apple, the kernell was of that you ſowed, or Peach or Plum &amp;c. the ſtone was ſet, ſuch fruite ſhall you haue within two or three yeares at the moſt after the grafting, if it take, and the ſtocke be good. And thus may you ſee fruit in farre leſſe time then to ſtay vntill the tree from a kernell or ſtone beareth fruit of it ſelfe.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Inarching is another manner of grafting in the ſtocke, and is more troubleſome, and more caſuall alſo then the former, and is rather a curioſity then any way of good ſpeede, certainety or profit, and therefore vſed but of a few. Yet to ſhew you, the
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:15790:279"/> manner thereof, it is thus: Hauing a tree well growne, bee it high or low, yet the lower the better, with young branches well ſpread, they vſe to ſet ſtockes round about it, or on the one ſide as you pleaſe; into which ſtockes they ingraft the young branches of the well growne tree as they are growing (before they cut them from the tree) by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe the branch they intend to graft, and putting it into the ſtocke, hauing firſt cut off the head thereof, and cut a notch in the middle of the head a little ſlope on both ſides, wherein the branch muſt be fitted: let the branch be cut thinne on the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſide, only of that length as may ſuffice to fit the notch in the ſtocke, leauing about halfe a yarde length of the branch, to riſe aboue or beyond the ſtocke, which beeing bound on, and clayed ouer or couered with red or greene ſoft waxe, they let ſo abide, that if it take in the ſtocke they cut off the branch a little below the grafting place in Nouember following, and remouing the ſtocke, they haue thus gained a grafted and growne tree the firſt yeare: but it is vſually ſeene, that where one branch taketh, three doe miſſe: yet this manner of grafting was much in vſe for May Cherries, when they were firſt known to vs, and the way thought to be a rare manner of grafting to encreaſe them, vntill a better way was found out, which now is ſo common and good alſo, that this is not now ſcarce thought vpon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another kinde of grafting in the ſtocke is called of ſome whipping, of ſome ſplicing, of others inciſing, and of others packing on (and as I heare, is much vſed in the Weſt parts eſpecially, and alſo in the North parts of this Land) and is performed in this manner: Take and ſlice the branch of a tree (ſo as the branch be not too bigge) or elſe a young tree of two, or three, or foure yeares growth at the moſt, quite off ſlope wiſe, about an inch and a halfe long or more, and cut a deep notch in the middle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then fit into it a graft iuſt of that ſize or bigneſſe, cut on both ſides with ſhoulders, and thin at the end, that it may ioyne cloſe in the notch, and neyther bigger or leſſer, but that the barke of the one may bee fitted iuſt to the barke of the other, the figure wherof is expreſſed at the letters E.F. which ſhew the one to be with a ſhoulder &amp; the other without; binde them gently together with baſt, and put clay or waxe ouer the place, vntill it be taken: this is much vſed of late dayes for ſuch young trees as are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of ſtones or kernels after the ſecond or third yeares growth, and thriue very well in that it not only ſaueth much time, but diuers checks by remouing and grafting.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Inoculating or grafting in the budde is another manner of grafting, which is the taking of a budde from one tree, and putting it into the barke of another tree, to the end, that thereby you may haue of the ſame kinde of fruit the tree bare from whence the budde was taken; and although it bee ſufficiently knowne in many places of this Land, yet as I vnderſtand, good Gardiners in the North parts, and likewiſe in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, can ſcarce tell what it meaneth, or at the leaſt how to doe it well. It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed after a different faſhion from the former, although they all tend vnto one end, which is the propagating of trees. You muſt for this purpoſe obſerue, that for thoſe trees you would graft, either with, or vpon, you chooſe a fit time in Summer, when the ſappe is well riſen, and your graft well ſhot, that the barke will riſe eaſily and cleanly, both of ſtocke and graft, which time I cannot appoint, becauſe both the years doe differ in earlineſſe, and the ſeuerall parts or countries of this Land likewiſe one from another, but moſt vſually in theſe Southerne parts, from the beginning of Iune vnto the end of it, or to the middle of Iuly, or either ſomewhat before or after. Firſt (as I ſaid) hauing taken the fitteſt time of the yeare, you muſt take eſpeciall care, that your grafts be well growne, and of the ſame yeares ſhoote, and alſo that the buds or eyes haue but ſingle leaues at them, as neare as you can: for I would vtterly refuſe thoſe buds that haue aboue two leaues as vnprofitable, either in Peaches or any other fruit; and therefore ſee that your grafts or cyons bee taken from the chiefeſt place of the tree, that is, either from the toppe, or from a ſunnie ſide thereof, and not from the contrarie ſide if you may otherwiſe, nor from any vnder-boughes; for ſeeing your graft is ſo ſmall a thing, you had neede take the more care that it be the beſt and faireſt. You muſt to take off this eye or budde from the ſprigge, haue a ſmall ſharpe pen-knife, the end of the haft being made flat and thinne, like a cheſſell or wedge, the figure whereof is ſet forth at the letter B, and a pen or gooſe quill cut, to be leſſe then halfe round, and to be broad at the end, but not ſharpe pointed like a penne, or elſe ſuch a peece of bone or Iuorie made in that faſhion as the quill is, to bee thinne, hollow, or <pb n="545" facs="tcp:15790:279"/> halfe round, the figures of both which are marked with the letters C, D. with your knife cut the barke of the bud (hauing firſt cut off the leafe, leauing onely the ſhort foote-ſtalke thereof at the bud) about a ſtrawes breadth aboue the eye thereof halfe round, and then from that round or ouerthwart cut, with your knife cut it downe on both ſides of the eye, cloſe to the bud ſlopewiſe about an inch long or thereabouts, that it bee broad at the head aboue the eye, and pointing at the end like a ſheild or ſcutcheon; and then cutting away the reſt of the barke from about it, with the thinne flat end of the haft of your knife raiſe vp both ſides of your bud a little, and with your quill or bone put vnder the barke, raiſe your budde, and thruſt it quite off, beginning at the toppe or head of your eye; but ſee that you thruſt it off cloſe to the wood of the branch or ſprigge, and that you doe not leaue the eye of the budde behinde ſticking vpon the branch; for if that eye be left or loſt, your bud is worth nothing; you muſt caſt it away, and cut another that may haue that eye abiding within the budde on the inſide: you may perceiue if that eye be wanting, if you ſee an emptie hole in the place where the eye ſhould be, to fill it vp on the inſide thereof; thus hauing taken off your bud well and cleanly, which is ſet forth vnto you at the figures 3 and 4. preſently ſet it on the tree you would graft (for your ſmall bud can abide no delay, leſt by taking the ayre too long it become dry, and nothing worth) in this manner: Cut the barke of your tree you would graft in a ſmooth place, at what height you pleaſe, firſt aboue or ouerthwart, and then downe right in the middle thereof, more then an inch long, the figure whereof you ſhall haue at the figure 1. and then raiſe vp both ſides of the barke, firſt one, and then another, with the flat and thinne haft end of your knife, a prettie way inwards (for if the barke will not riſe eaſily, the ſtocke is not then fit to graft vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) put in your budde into the cleft with the point downewards, holding the ſtalke of the leafe that is with the budde betweene your fingers of the one hand, and opening the cleft with the flat end of your knife with the other hand, that the head of your bud may be put cloſe vnder the ouerthwart cut in the ſtocke or tree (which muſt not be raiſed or ſtirred as the ſides are) &amp; the eye of the bud ſtand iuſt in the middle of the ſlit that is downeright, and then cloſing the barke of the ſtocke or tree ſoftly vnto the bud thus put in with your fingers, let it be bound gently with a ſmall long peece of baſte, or other ſuch like ſoft thing, firſt aboue the eye, &amp; then compaſſing it belowe as cloſe as you can, but not too hard in any caſe, vntil you haue bound it all ouer the ſlit you made, eſpecially the lower end, leſt any winde get in to dry and ſpoile it; and hauing tyed both ends thereof faſt, leaue it ſo for a fornight or ſomewhat more, in which ſpace it will take and hold, if it be well done, which you ſhall perceiue, if the bud abide green, and turne not blacke, when you haue vnlooſed the tying; for if it hold faſt to the tree, and be freſh and good, tye it vp gently againe, and ſo leaue it for a fortnight longer, or a moneth if you will, and then you may take away your binding cleane: this budde will (if no other miſchance happen vnto it) ſpring and ſhoote forth the next yeare, (and ſometimes the ſame yeare, but that is ſeldome) and therefore in the beginning of the yeare, cut off the head of the grafted tree about an handfull aboue the grafted place, vntill the graft be growne ſtrong, and then cut it off cloſe, that the head may be couered with the graft, and doe not ſuffer any buds to ſprout beſides the graft, either aboue or belowe it. If you graft diuers buds vpon one ſtocke (which is the beſt way) let that onely remaine and abide that ſhooteth beſt forth, and rubbe off, or take away the other: the ſeuerall parts of this grafting I haue cauſed to be expreſſed for your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther information.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Grafting in the ſcutcheon is accounted another kinde of grafting, and differeth verie little from grafting in the budde: the difference chiefly conſiſteth in this, that in ſtead of the downe right ſlit, and that aboue ouerthwart, they take away iuſt ſo much barke of the great tree, as your bud is in bigneſſe, which vſually is a little larger then the former, and placing it therein, they binde it as formerly is ſaid: ſome vſe for this purpoſe a paire of compaſſes, to giue the true meaſure both of bud and ſtocke; this manner of grafting is moſt vſed vpon greater trees, whoſe young branches are too high to graft vpon in the former maner, and whoſe tops they cut off (for the moſt part) at the latter end of the next yeare after the bud is taken: both theſe waies were inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſaue the loſſe of trees, which are more endangered by grafting in the ſtocke, <pb n="546" facs="tcp:15790:280"/> then any of theſe waies; and beſides, by theſe waies you may graft at a farre grea height without loſſe.</p>

                  <p>HAuing now ſpoken of the grafting of trees, let mee adioyne the properties of Roſes, which although they better fit a Garden then an Orchard, yet I could not in a fitter place expreſſe them then here, both for the name and affinity of grafting, &amp; becauſe I do not expreſſe it in the firſt part. All ſorts of Roſes may be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (although all ſorts are not, ſome ſeruing rather for ſtockes for others to be grafted on) as eaſily as any other tree, &amp; is only performed, by inoculating in the ſame maner I haue ſet downe in the former Chapter of grafting trees in the bud; for both ſtocke and budde muſt bee dealt with after the ſame faſhion. And although ſome haue boaſted of grafting Roſes by ſlicing or whipping, as they call it, or in the ſtocke, after the firſt manner, ſet downe in the former Chapter, yet I thinke it rather a bragge, not hauing ſeene or heard any true effect proceede from that relation. The ſweete Briar or Eglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, the white and the Damaske Roſes, are the chiefeſt ſtockes to graft vpon. And if you graft lowe or neare the ground, you may by laying downe that graft within the ground, after it hath bin ſhot out well, and of a years growth, by pinning it faſt downe with ſhort ſtickes, a thwart or acroſſe, cauſe that grafted branch, by taking roote, to become a naturall Roſe, ſuch as the graft was, which being ſeparated and tranſplanted after it hath taken root wel, will proſper as well as any naturall ſucker. And in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by laying downe branchese at length into the ground, if they be full of ſpreading ſmall branches, you may increaſe all ſorts of Roſes quickly and plentifully; for they will ſhoote forth rootes at the ioynt of euery branch: But as for the manner of grafting white Roſes or Damaske vpon Broome ſtalkes or Barbary buſhes, to cauſe them to bring forth double yellow Roſes, or vpon a Willowe, to beare greene Roſes, they are all idle conceits, as impoſſible to be effected, as other things, whereof I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ninth Chapter of my firſt part, concerning a Garden of flowers, vnto which I referre you to be ſatisfied with the reaſons there alledged. And it is the more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, becauſe we haue a naturall double yellow Roſe of it owne growing. The ſowing of the ſeedes of Roſes (which are ſometimes found vpon moſt ſorts of Roſes, although not euery yeare, and in euerie place) hath bin formerly much vſed; but now the laying downe of the young ſhootes is a way for increaſe ſo much vſed, being ſafe and verie ſpeedie to take, eſpecially for thoſe Roſes that are not ſo apt to giue ſuckers, that it hath almoſt taken quite away the vſe of ſowing of the ſeedes of Roſes, which yet if anie one bee diſpoſed to make the triall, they muſt gather the ſeede out of the round heads, from amongſt the doune, wherein they lye verie like vnto the berries of the Eglantine or ſweete Briar buſh, and eſpecially of thoſe Roſes that bee of the more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle kindes, which are more apt to giue berries for ſeed then the more double, although ſometimes the double Roſes yeeld the like heads or berries. Their time of ſowing is in the end of September (yet ſome reſerue them vntill February) and their manner of nourſing is to bee tranſplanted, after the firſt or ſecond yeares growth, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded carefully, that while they are young they be not loſt for want of moiſture in the dry time of Summer.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Certaine rules and obſeruations in and after grafting, not remembred in the former Chapter.</head>
                  <p>THe time of ſome manners of grafting being not mentioned before, muſt here be ſpoken of. For the grafting of all ſorts of trees in the ſtocke, the moſt vſuall time is from the middle of February vntill the middle of March, as the yeare and the countrie is more forward or backward, with vs about London wee neuer paſſe midde March: but becauſe the May Cherrie is firſt ripe, and therefore of a very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nature, it doth require to be grafted ſomewhat ſooner then others. The time of gathering likewiſe, or cutting your grafts for grafting in the ſtocke, is to be obſerued, that they bee not long gathered before they bee grafted, for feare of being too dry, which I commend, howſoeuer diuers ſay, if they be long kept they are not the worſe; and therefore if you be forced to haue your grafts from farre, or by ſome other chance to keepe them long, be carefull to keepe them moiſt, by keeping their ends ſtucke in moiſt clay; but if neare hand, neglect no time I ſay after the cutting of them for their grafting, but either the ſame, or the next day, or verie ſpeedily after, in the meane time being put into the ground to keepe them freſh. The grafts taken from old trees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſtronger, and ſhoote forth ſooner, are to bee ſooner grafted then thoſe that are taken from younger trees: of a good branch may bee made two, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three grafts ſufficient for anie reaſonable ſtocke. For whipping, the time is ſomewhat later then grafting in the ſtocke, becauſe it is performed on younger trees, which (as I ſaid before) doe not ſo early bud or ſhoote forth as the elder. Inarching likewiſe is performed much about the later end of the grafting time in the ſtocke; for being both kindes thereof they require the ſame time of the yeare. The times of the other manners of graftings are before expreſſed, to bee when they haue ſhot forth young branches, from whence your buds muſt be taken; and therefore need not here againe to be repeated. If a graft in the ſtocke doth happen not to ſhoote forth when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do (ſo as it holdeth green) it may perchance ſhoot out a moneth or two after, &amp; do well, or elſe after Midſummer, when a ſecond time of ſhooting, or the after Spring ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth: but haue an eſpeciall care, that you take not ſuch a graft that ſhal haue nothing but buds for flowers vpon it, and not an eye or bud for leaues (which you muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to diſtinguiſh) for ſuch a graft after it hath ſhot out the flowers muſt of neceſſitie dye, not hauing wherewith to maintaine it ſelfe. Alſo if your good graft doe miſſe, and not take, it doth hazzard your ſtocke at the firſt time, yet manie ſtockes doe recouer to be grafted the ſecond time; but twice to faile is deadly, which is not ſo in the inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of buds in the greene tree: for if you faile therein three, or three times three, yet euerie wound being ſmall, and the tree ſtill growing greene, will quickly recouer it, and not be afterwards ſeen. Some vſe to graft in the ſtocke the ſame yeare they remoue the ſtocke, to ſaue time, &amp; a ſecond checke by grafting; but I like better both in grafting in the ſtocke, and in the bud alſo, that your trees might be planted in the places where you would haue them growe, for a yeare or two at the leaſt before you graft them, that after grafting there ſhould be no remouall, I neede not be tedious, not yet I hope ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſollicitous to remember many other triuiall, or at the leaſt common knowne things in this matter. Firſt, for the time to remoue trees, young or old, grafted or vngrafted, to be from a fortnight after Michaelmas vntill Candlemas, or if neede be, ſomewhat after, yet the ſooner your remoue is, the better your trees will thriue, except it be in a very moiſt ground. For the manner or way to ſet them: <hi>viz.</hi> in the high and dry grounds ſet them deeper, both to haue the more moiſture, and to be the better defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from windes; and in the lower and moiſter grounds ſhallower, and that the earth be mellow, well turned vp, and that the finer earth bee put among the ſmall rootes, wherein they may ſpread, and afterwards gently troden downe, that no hollowneſſe remaine among the rootes: as alſo that after ſetting (if the time be not ouermoiſt) there may be ſome water powred to the rootes, to moiſten and faſten them the better; and in the dry time of Summer, after the ſetting, let them not want moiſture, if you will <pb n="548" facs="tcp:15790:281"/> haue them thriue and proſper; for the want thereof at that time, hath often Killed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a likely tree. To ſtake and fence them alſo if neede bee after they are new ſet, and ſo to continue for two or three yeares after, is verie expedient, leſt windes or other caſualties ſpoile your paines, and ouerthrow your hopes. And likewiſe to defend your grafts from birds lighting on them, to breake or diſplace them, to ſticke ſome prickes or ſharpe pointed ſtickes longer then your graft into your clay, that ſo they may be a ſure defence of it: As alſo to tye ſome woollen cloathes about the lower end of your ſtockes, or thruſt in ſome thornes into the ground about the rootes, to defend them from hauing their barkes eaten by

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Obſeruations for the dreſsing and well keeping of Trees and an Orchard in good order.</head>
                  <p>THere are two manner of waies to dreſſe and keepe trees in good order, that they may bee both gracefull and fruitfull; the one is for wall-trees, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is for ſtandards: for as their formes are different, ſo is their keeping or ordering. Wall trees, becauſe they are grafted lowe, and that their branches muſt be plaſht or tackt vnto the wall to faſten them, are to be ſo kept, that all their branches may be ſuffered to growe, that ſhoote forth on eithet ſide of the bodie, and led either along the wall, or vpright, and one to lappe ouer or vnder another as is convenient, and ſtill with peeces of liſts, parings of felt, peeces of ſoft leather, or other ſuch like ſoft thing compaſſing the armes or branches, faſtened with ſmall or great nailes, as neede requireth, to the wals, onely thoſe buds or branches are to be nipped or cut off, that ſhoot forward, and will not ſo handſomely be brought into conformity, as is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; yet if the branches growe too thicke, to hinder the good of the reſt, or too high for the wall, they may, nay they muſt be cut away or lopped off: and if anie dead branches alſo happen to be on the trees, they muſt be cut away, that the reſt may haue the more libertie to thriue. Diuers alſo by carefully nipping away the waſte and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous buds, doe keepe their trees in conformity, without much cutting. The time to pruine or plaſh, or tye vp wall trees, is vſually from the fall of the leafe, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the yeare, when they begin to bloſſome, and moſt eſpecially a little before or after Chriſtmas: but in any caſe not too late, for feare of rubbing off their buds. Some I know doe plaſh and tye vp their wall trees after bearing time, while the leaues are greene, and their reaſon is, the buds are not ſo eaſie or apt to bee rubbed from the branches at that time, as at Chriſtmas, when they are more growne: but the leaues muſt needes be very cumberſome, to hinder much both the orderly placing, and cloſe faſtening of them to the wall. This labour you muſt performe euery yeare in its due time; for if you ſhall neglect and ouerſlip it, you ſhall haue much more trouble, to bring them into a fit order againe, then at the firſt. The ſtandard trees in an Orchard muſt be kept in another order; for whereas the former are ſuffered to ſpread at large, theſe muſt be pruined both from ſuperfluous branches that ouerload the trees, &amp; make them leſſe fruitfull, as well as leſſe ſightly, and the vnder or water boughes likewiſe, that drawe much nouriſhment from the trees, and yet themſelues little the better for it, I meane to giue fruit. If therefore your Orchard conſiſt of young trees, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care and paines it may bee kept in that comely order and proportion it was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined vnto; but if it conſiſt of old growne trees, they will not without a great deale of care and paines be brought into ſuch conformitie, as is befitting good and comely trees: for the marke of thoſe boughes or branches that are cut off from young trees, will quickly be healed againe, the barke growing quickly ouer them, whereby they are not worſe for their cutting; but an old tree if you cut off a bough, you muſt cut it cloſe and cleanly, and lay a ſearcloth of tallow, waxe, and a little pitch melted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the place, to keepe off both the winde, ſunne, and raine, vntill the barke haue couered it ouer againe: and in this manner you muſt deale withall ſuch ſhort ſtumps of branches, as are either broken ſhort off with the winde, or by careleſneſſe of <pb n="549" facs="tcp:15790:281"/> want of skill, or elſe ſuch armes or branches as are broken off cloſe, or ſliued from the body of the tree: for the raine beating and falling into ſuch a place, will in ſhort time rotte your tree, or put it in danger, beſides the deformity. Some vſe to fill vp ſuch an hole with well tempered clay, and tacke a cloth or a peece of leather ouer it vntill it be recouered, and this is alſo not amiſſe. Your young trees, if they ſtand in anie good ground, will bee plentifull enough in ſhooting forth branches; bee carefull therefore if they growe too thicke, that you pruine away ſuch as growe too cloſe (and will, if they be ſuffered, ſpoile one another) as they may be beſt ſpared, that ſo the ſunne, ayre, and raine may haue free acceſſe to all your branches, which will make them beare the more plentifully, and ripen them the ſooner and the more kindly. If anie boughes growe at the toppe too high, cut them alſo away, that your trees may rather ſpread then growe too high. And ſo likewiſe for the vnder boughes, or anie other that by the weight of fruit fall or hang downe, cut them off at the halfe, and they will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards riſe and ſhoote vpwards. You ſhall obſerue, that at all thoſe places where anie branches haue been cut away, the ſappe will euer bee readie to put forth: if therefore you would haue no more branches riſe from that place, rubbe off or nippe off ſuch buddes as are not to your minde, when they are new ſhot: and thus you may keep your trees in good order with a little paines, after you haue thus pruined and dreſſed them. One other thing I would aduertiſe you of, and that is how to preſerue a fainting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying tree which is readie to periſh, if it be not gone too farre or paſt cure, take a good quantitie of oxe or horſe bloud, mixe therewith a reaſonable quantitie of ſheepe or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons dung, which being laid to the roote, will by the often raines and much watering recouer it ſelfe, if there bee anie poſſibilitie; but this muſt bee done in Ianuarie or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruarie at the furtheſt.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Diuers other obſeruations to be remembred in the well keeping of an Orchard.</head>
                  <p>THere be diuers other things to be mentioned, whereof care muſt be had, either to doe or auoide, which I thinke fit in this Chapter promiſcuouſly to ſet down, that there may be nothing wanting to furniſh you with ſufficient knowledge of the care, paines, and caſualties that befall an Orchard: for it hath many enemies, and euery one laboureth as much as in them lye, to ſpoile you of your pleaſure, or profit, or both, which muſt bee both ſpeedily and carefully preuented and helped; and they are theſe: Moſſe, Caterpillars, Ants, Earwigs, Snailes, Moales, and Birds. If Moſſe begin to ouergrowe your trees, looke to it betimes, leſt it make your trees barren: Some vſe to hacke, and croſſehacke, or cut the barke of the bodies of their trees, to cauſe it fall away; but I feare it may endanger your trees. Others do either rubbe it off with a haire cloth, or with a long peece of wood formed like a knife, at the end of a long ſticke or pole, which if it bee vſed cautelouſly without hurting the buds, I like better. Caterpillars, ſome ſmoake them with burning wet ſtrawe or hay, or ſuch like ſtuffe vnder the trees; but I doe not greatly like of that way: others cut off the boughes whereon they breed, and tread them vnder their feete, but that will ſpoile too manie branches; and ſome kill them with their hands: but ſome doe vſe a new deuiſed way, that is, a pompe made of lattin or tin, ſpout-faſhion, which being ſet in a tubbe of water vnder or neare your trees, they will cauſe the water to riſe through it with ſuch a force, and through the branches, that it will waſh them off quickly. To deſtroy Ants, that eate your fruit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and when it is ripe, ſome vſe to annoint the bodies of their trees with tarre, that they may not creepe vp on the branches; but if that doe not helpe, or you will not vſe it, you muſt be carefull to finde out their hill, and turne it vp, pouring in ſcalding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, either in Summer, but eſpecially if you can in Winter, and that will ſurely deſtroy them. I haue ſpoken of Earwigs in the firſt part of this worke, entreating of the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Gilloflowers, and therefore I referre you thereunto: yet one way more I <pb n="550" facs="tcp:15790:282"/> will here relate which ſome doe vſe, and that is with hollow canes of halfe a yard long or more, open at both ends for them to creepe in, and ſtucke or laid among the branches of your trees, will ſoone drawe into them many Earwigs, which you may ſoone kill, by knocking the cane a little vpon the ground, and treading on them with your foote. Snailes muſt be taken with your hands, and that euerie day, eſpecially in the morning when they will be creeping abroad. Moales by running vnder your trees make them leſſe fruitfull, and alſo put them in danger to be blowne downe, by leauing the ground hollow, that thereby the rootes haue not that ſtrength in the ground, both to ſhoote and to hold, that otherwiſe they might haue. Some haue vſed to put Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, and other ſuch like things into their holes, thinking thereby to driue them away, but to no purpoſe: others haue tryed manie other waies; but no way doth auaile anie thing, but killing them either with a Moale ſpade, or a trappe made for the purpoſe as manie doe know: and they muſt bee watched at their principall hill, and trenched round, and ſo to be caught. Birds are another enemie both to your trees and fruit; for the Bullfinch will deſtroy all your ſtone fruit in the budde, before they flower, if you ſuffer them, and Crowes, &amp;c. when your Cherries are ripe: for the ſmaller birds, Lime twigs ſet either neare your trees, or at the next water where they drinke, will helpe to catch them and deſtroy them. And for the greater birds, a ſtone bowe, a birding or fowling peece will helpe to leſſen their number, and make the reſt more quiet: or a mill with a clacke to ſcarre them away, vntill your fruit be gathered. Some other annoyances there are, as ſuckers that riſe from the rootes of your trees, which muſt be taken away euerie yeare, and not ſuffered to growe anie thing great, for feare of robbing your trees of their liuelihood. Barke bound, is when a tree doth not ſhoote and encreaſe, by reaſon the barke is as it were drie, and will not ſuffer the ſappe to paſſe vnto the branches: take a knife therefore, and ſlit the barke downe almoſt all the length of the tree in two or three places, and it will remedy that euill, and the tree will thriue and come forward the better after. Barke pilled is another euill that happeneth to ſome trees, as well young as old, either by reaſon of caſuall hurts, or by the gnawing of beaſts, howſoeuer it bee, if it bee anie great hurt, lay a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thereon made of tallow, tarre, and a little pitch, and binde it thereto, letting it ſo abide vntill the wound bee healed: yet ſome doe only apply a little clay or loame bound on with ropes of hay. The Canker is a ſhrewd diſeaſe when it happeneth to a tree; for it will eate the barke round, and ſo kill the very heart in a little ſpace. It muſt be looked vnto in time before it hath runne too farre; moſt men doe wholly cut away as much as is fretted with the Canker, and then dreſſe it, or wet it with vinegar or Cowes piſſe, or Cowes dung and vrine, &amp;c. vntill it be deſtroyed, and after healed againe with your ſalue before appointed. There are yet ſome other enemies to an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard: for if your fence be not of bricke or ſtone, but either a mudde wall, or a quicke ſet or dead hedge, then looke to it the more carefully, and preuent the comming in of either horſe, or kine, ſheepe, goates, or deere, hare, or conie; for ſome of them will breake through or ouer to barke your trees, and the leaſt hole almoſt in the hedge will giue admittance to hares and conies to doe the like. To preuent all which, your care muſt be continuall to watch them or auoide them, and to ſtoppe vp their entrance. A dogge is a good ſeruant for many ſuch purpoſes, and ſo is a ſtone bowe, and a peece to make vſe of as occaſion ſhall ſerue. But if you will take that medicine for a Canker ſpoken of before, which is Cowes dung and vrine mixed together, and with a bruſh waſh your trees often to a reaſonable height, will keepe hares and conies from eating or barking your trees. Great and cold windes doe often make a great ſpoile in an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, but great trees planted without the compaſſe thereof, as Wall-nuts, Oakes, Elmes, Aſhes, and the like, will ſtand it in great ſtead, to defend it both early and late. Thus haue I ſhewed you moſt of the euils that may happen to an Orchard, and the meanes to helpe them, and becauſe the number is great and daily growing, the care and paines muſt be continuall, the more earneſt and diligent, leſt you loſe that in a moment that hath been growing many yeares, or at the leaſt the profit or beauty of ſome yeares fruit.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The manner and way how to plant, order, and keepe other trees that beare greene leaues continually.</head>
                  <p>THe way to order thoſe trees that beare their leaues greene continually, is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from all others that doe not ſo: for neyther are they to bee planted or remoued at the time that all other trees are ſet, nor doe they require that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dreſſing, pruining and keeping, that others doe. And although many ignorant perſons and Gardiners doe remoue Bay trees, and are ſo likewiſe perſwaded that all other trees of that nature, that is, that carry their greene leaues continually, may bee remoued in Autumne or Winter, as well as all other trees may bee; yet it is certaine it is a great chance if they doe thriue and proſper that are ſet at that time, or rather it is found by experience, that ſcarce one of ten proſpereth well that are ſo ordered. Now in regard that there be diuers trees and ſhrubs mentioned here in this booke that beare euer greene leaues, wherein there is very great beauty, and many take pleaſure in them; as the ordinary Bay, the Roſe Bay, and the Cherry Bay trees, the Indian Figge, the Cypreſſe, the Pine tree, the Mirtle and dwarfe Boxe, and many others; I will here ſhew you how to plant and order them, as is fitteſt for them. For in that they doe not ſhed their greene leaues in winter as other trees doe, you may in reaſon be perſwaded that they are of another nature; and ſo they are indeede: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they all grow naturally in warme Countries, and are from thence brought vnto vs, we muſt both plant them in a warmer place, and tranſplant them in a warmer time then other trees be, or elſe it is a great hazzard if they doe not periſh and dye, the cold and froſts in the winter being able to pierce them through, if they ſhould bee tranſplanted in winter, before they haue taken roote. You muſt obſerue and take this therefore for a certaine rule, that you alwaies remoue ſuch trees or ſhrubbes as are euer greene in the ſpring of the yeare, and at no time elſe if you will doe well, that is, from the end of March, or beginning of Aprill, vnto the middle or end of May, eſpecially your more dainty and tender plants, ſhadowing them alſo for a while from the heate of the Sun, and giuing them a little water vpon their planting or tranſplanting; but ſuch water as hath not preſently been drawn from a Well or Pumpe, for that will go neer to kill any plant, but ſuch water as hath ſtood in the open ayre for a day at the leaſt, if not two or three. Yet for dwarfe Boxe I confeſſe it may endure one moneth to be earlier planted then the reſt, becauſe it is both a more hardy and lowe plant, and thereby not ſo much ſubiect to the extremitie of the colde: but if you ſhould plant it before winter, the froſts would raiſe it out of the ground, becauſe it cannot ſo ſoone at that time of the yeare take roote, and thereby put it in danger to be loſt. Moreouer all of them will not abide the extremitie of our winter froſts, and therefore you muſt of neceſſity houſe ſome of them, as the Roſe Bay, Mirtle, and ſome others, but the other ſorts being ſet where they may bee ſomewhat defended from the cold windes, froſtes, and ſnow in winter, with ſome couering or ſhelter for the time, will reaſonably well endure and beare their fruit, or the moſt of them. If any be deſirous to be furniſhed with ſtore of theſe kinds of trees that will be nourſed vp in our Country, he may by ſowing the ſeed of them in ſquare or long woodden boxes or cheſts made for that purpoſe, gaine plenty of them: but hee muſt be carefull to couer them in winter with ſome ſtraw or fearne, or beane hame, or ſuch like thing layd vpon croſſe ſticks to beare it vp from the plants, and after two or three yeares that they are growne ſomewhat great and ſtrong, they may bee tranſplanted into ſuch places you meane they ſhall abide: yet it is not amiſſe to defend them the firſt yeare after they are tranſplanted, for their more ſecuritie: the ſeedes that are moſt vſually ſowen with vs, are, the Cypreſſe tree, the Pine tree, the Baye, the Pyracantha or prickly Corall tree, and the Mirtle: the Roſe Bay I haue had alſo riſen from the ſeede that was freſh, and brought me from Spaine. But as for Orenge trees, becauſe they are ſo hardly preſerued in this our cold climate (vnleſſe it bee with ſome that doe beſtow the houſing of them, beſides a great deale more of care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto them) from the bitterneſſe of our cold long winter weather (although their
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:15790:283"/> kernels being put into the ground in the Spring or Summer, and if care bee had of them and conuenient keeping, will abide, and by grafting the good fruite on the crab ſtocke they may bee in time nurſed vp) I doe not make any other eſpeciall account of them, nor giue you any further relation of their ordering. Now for the ordering of theſe trees after they are eyther planted of young ſets, or tranſplanted from the ſeede, it is thus: Firſt for Bay trees, the moſt vſuall way is to let them grow vp high to bee trees, and many plant them on the North or Eaſt ſide of their houſes that they may not bee ſcorched with the Sunne; but the bitter winters which we often haue, doe pinch them ſhrewdly, inſomuch that it killeth euen well growne trees ſometimes downe to the roote: but ſome doe make a hedge of them being planted in order, and keep them low by lopping of them continually, which will make them buſh and ſpread. The Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tree is neuer lopped, but ſuffered to grow with all the branches from a foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ground, if it may be, ſtraight vpright; for that is his natiue grace and greateſt beautie, and therefore the more branches doe dye that they muſt bee cut away, the more you deforme his propertie. The Pine tree may be vſed in the ſame manner, but yet it wil better endure to ſuſtaine pruining then the Cypreſſe, without any ſuch defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. The Lauroceraſus or Cherry Bay may be diuerſly formed, that is, it may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made to grow into a tall tree by ſhredding ſtill away the vnder branches, or elſe by ſuffering all the branches to grow to be a low or hedge buſh, &amp; both by the ſuckers and by laying downe the lower branches into the earth, you may ſoone haue much increaſe; but this way will cauſe it to bee the longer before it beare anie fruit. The Roſe Baye will verie hardlie bee encreaſed either by ſuckers or by layers, but muſt bee ſuffered to grow without lopping, topping or cutting. The Pyracantha or Prickly Corall tree may bee made to grow into a reaſonable tall tree by ſhredding away the lower branches, or it may be ſuffered to grow lowe into an hedge buſh, by ſuffering all the branches to grow continually, you may alſo propagate it by the ſuckers, or by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe the lower branches. The Myrtle of all ſorts abideth a low buſh ſpreading his branches full of ſweete leaues and flowers, without anie great encreaſe of it ſelfe, yet ſometimes it giueth ſuckers or ſhootes from the rootes: but for the more ſpeedie propagating of them, ſome doe put the cuttings of them into the earth, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them. There are ſome other trees that are not of any great reſpect, as the Yew tree, and the Savine buſh, both which may be encreaſed by the cuttings, and therefore I need not make any further relation or amplification of them, and to ſay thus much of them all, is (I thinke) ſufficient for this Worke.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The ordering, curing, and propagating Vines of all ſorts.</head>
                  <p>IN moſt places of this countrie there is ſmall care or paines taken about the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Vines: it ſufficeth for the moſt part with them that haue anie, to make a frame for it to ſpread vpon aboue a mans height, or to tacke it to a wall or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, &amp;c. and ſo to let it hang downe with the branches and fruit, vntill the weight thereof, and the force of windes doe teare it downe oftentimes, and ſpoile the grapes: and this way doth ſomewhat reſemble that courſe that the Vineyard keepers obſerue in the hot countries of Syria, Spaine, and Italy, and in the furtheſt parts of France as I hear likewiſe: for in moſt of theſe hot countries they vſe to plant an Oliue betweene two Vines, and let them runne thereupon. But manie of the other parts of France, &amp;c. doe not ſuffer anie trees to growe among their Vines; and therefore they plant them thicke, and pruine them much and often, and keepe them lowe in compariſon of the other way, faſtening them to pearches or poles to hold them vp. And according to that faſhion many haue aduentured to make Vineyards in England, not onely in theſe later daies, but in ancient times, as may wel witneſſe the ſundrie places in this Land, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled by the name of Vineyards; and I haue read, that manie Monaſteries in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hauing Vineyards, had as much wine made therefrom, as ſufficed their couents yeare by yeare: but long ſince they haue been deſtroyed, and the knowledge how to order a Vineyard is alſo vtterly periſhed with them. For although diuers, both No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:15790:283"/> and Gentlemen, haue in theſe later times endeauoured to plant and make Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and to that purpoſe haue cauſed French men, being skilfull in keeping and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Vines, to be brought ouer to performe it, yet either their skill failed them, or their Vines were not good, or (the moſt likely) the ſoile was not fitting; for they could neuer make anie wine that was worth the drinking, being ſo ſmall and heartleſſe, that they ſoone gaue ouer their practice. And indeede the ſoile is a maine matter to bee chiefly conſidered to ſeate a Vineyard vpon: for euen in France and other hot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, according to the nature of the ſoile, ſo is the relliſh, ſtrength, and durabilitie of the wine. Now although I think it a fruitleſſe labour for any man to ſtriue in theſe daies to make a good Vineyard in England, in regard not only of the want of knowledge, to make choiſe of the fitteſt ground for ſuch Vines as you would plant therupon, but alſo of the true maner of ordering them in our country; but moſt chiefly &amp; aboue all others, that our years in theſe times do not fal out to be ſo kindly and hot, to ripen the grapes, to make anie good wine as formerly they haue done; yet I thinke it not amiſſe, to giue you inſtructions how to order ſuch Vines as you may nourſe vp for the pleaſure of the fruit, to eate the grapes being ripe, or to preſerue and keepe them to bee eaten almoſt all the winter following: And this may be done without any great or extraordinarie paines. Some doe make a lowe wall, and plant their Vines againſt it, and keepe them much about the height thereof, not ſuffering them to riſe much higher: but if the high bricke or ſtone wals of your Garden or Orchard haue buttreſſes thereat, or if you cauſe ſuch to bee made, that they bee ſomewhat broade forwards, you may the more conueniently plant Vines of diuers ſorts at them, and by ſticking down a couple of good ſtakes at euery buttreſſe, of eight or ten foot high aboue ground, tacking a few lathes acroſſe vpon thoſe ſtakes, you may therunto tye your Vines, &amp; carry them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at your pleaſure: but you muſt be carefull to cut them euery year, but not too late, and ſo keepe them downe, and from farre ſpreading, that they neuer runne much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the frame which you ſet at the buttreſſes: as alſo in your cutting you neuer leaue too many ioynts, nor yet too few, but at the third or fourth ioint at the moſt cut them off. I doe aduiſe you to theſe frames made with ſtakes and lathes, for the better ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your grapes: for in the blooming time, if the branches of your vines bee too neare the wall, the reflection of the Sunne in the day time, and the colde in the night, doe oftentimes ſpoile a great deale of fruit, by piercing and withering the tender foot-ſtalkes of the grapes, before they are formed, whereas when the bloſſomes are paſt, and the fruit growing of ſome bigneſſe, then all the heate and reflection you can giue them is fit, and therefore cut away ſome of the branches with the leaues, to admit the more Sunne to ripen the fruit. For the diuers ſorts of grapes I haue ſet them downe in the Booke following, with briefe notes vpon euerie of them, whether white or blacke, ſmall or great, early or late ripe; ſo that I neede not here make the ſame relation again. There doth happen ſome diſeaſes to Vines ſometimes, which that you may helpe, I thinke it conuenient to informe you what they are, and how to remedy them when you ſhall be troubled with any ſuch. The firſt is a luxurious ſpreading of branches and but little or no fruit: for remedie whereof, cut the branches ſomewhat more neere then vſuall, and bare the roote, but take heed of wounding or hurting it, and in the hole put either ſome good old rotten ſtable dung of Horſes, of elſe ſome Oxe blood new taken from the beaſts, and that in the middle of Ianuarie or beginning of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, which being well tempered and turned in with the earth, let it ſo abide, which no doubt, when the comfort of the blood or dung is well ſoaked to the bottome by the raines that fall thereon, will cauſe your Vine to fructifie againe. Another fault is, when a Vine doth not bring the fruit to ripeneſſe, but either it withereth before it be growne of any bigneſſe, or preſently after the blooming: the place or the earth where ſuch a Vine ſtandeth, aſſuredly is too cold, and therefore if the fault bee not in the place, which cannot bee helped without remouing to a better, digge out a good quantity of that earth, and put into the place thereof ſome good freſh ground well heartned with dung, and ſome ſand mixed therewith (but not ſalt or ſalt water, as ſome doe aduiſe, nor yet vrine, as others would haue) and this will hearten and ſtrengthen your Vine to beare out the frut vnto maturitie. When the leaues of a Vine in the end of Summer or in Autumne, vntimely doe turne either yellow or red, it is a great ſigne the earth is <pb n="554" facs="tcp:15790:284"/> too hot and drie; you muſt therefore in ſtead of dung and ſand, as in the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is ſaid, put in ſome freſh loame or ſhort clay, well mixed together with ſome of the earth, and ſo let them abide, that the froſts may mellow them. And laſtly, a Vine ſometimes beareth ſome ſtore of grapes, but they are too many for it to bring to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; you ſhall therefore helpe ſuch a Vine (which no doubt is of ſome excellent kinde, for they are moſt vſually ſubiect to this fault) by nipping away the bloſſomes from the branches, and leauing but one or two bunches at the moſt vpon a branch, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Vine be growne older, and thereby ſtronger, and by this meane inured to beare out all the grapes to ripeneſſe. Theſe be all the diſeaſes I know doe happen to Vines: for the bleeding of a Vine it ſeldome happeneth of it ſelfe, but commeth either by cutting it vntimely, that is, too late in the yeare, (for after Ianuarie, if you will be well aduiſed, cut not any Vine) or by ſome caſuall or wilfull breaking of an arme or a branch. This bleeding in ſome is vnto death, in others it ſtayeth after a certaine ſpace of it ſelfe: To helpe this inconuenience, ſome haue ſeared the place where it bleedeth with an hot iron, which in many haue done but a little good; others haue bound the barke cloſe with packe-thred to ſtay it; and ſome haue tied ouer the place, being firſt dried as well as may bee, a plaiſter made with waxe roſſen and turpentine while it is warme. Now for the propagating of them: You muſt take the faireſt and goaleſt ſhot branches of one yeares growth, and cut them off with a peece of the old wood vnto it, and theſe being put into the ground before the end of Ianuarie at the furtheſt, will ſhoote forth, and take roote, and ſo become Vines of the ſame kinde from whence you tooke them. This is the moſt ſpeedy way to haue increaſe: for the laying downe of branches to take roote, doth not yeelde ſuch ſtore ſo plentifully, nor doe ſuckers riſe from the rootes ſo aboundantly; yet both theſe waies doe yeelde Vines, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from the old ſtockes will become young plants, fit to bee diſpoſed of as any ſhall thinke meete.</p>

                  <p>ALthough it bee common and vſuall in the parts beyond the Sea to dry their grapes in the Sunne, thereby to preſerue them all the year, as the Raiſins of the Sunne are, which cannot bee done in our Countrie for the want of ſufficient heate thereof at that time: or otherwiſe to ſcald them in hot water (as I heare) and afterwards to dry them, and ſo keepe them all the yeare, as our Malaga Raiſins are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared that are packed vp into Frayles: yet I doe intend to ſhew you ſome other waies to preſerue the grapes of our Countrie freſh, that they may be eaten in the winter both before and after Chriſtmas with as much delight and pleaſure almoſt, as when they were new gathered. One way is, when you haue gathered your grapes you intend to keepe, which muſt be in a dry time, and that all the ſhrunke, dried, or euill grapes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery bunch be picked away, and hauing prouided a veſſell to hold them, be it of wood or ſtone which you will, and a ſufficient quantitie of faire and cleane drie ſand; make <hi>ſtratum ſuper ſtratum</hi> of your grapes and the ſand, that is, a lay of ſand in the bottome firſt, and a lay of grapes vpon them, and a lay or ſtrowing againe of ſand vpon thoſe grapes, ſo that the ſand may couer euery lay of grapes a fingers breadth in thickneſſe, which being done one vpon another vntill the veſſell be full, and a lay of ſand vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, let the veſſell be ſtopped cloſe, and ſet by vntill you pleaſe to ſpend them, being kept in ſome drie place and in no ſellar: let them bee waſhed cleane in faire water to take away the ſand from ſo many you will ſpend at a time. Another way is (which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarius ſetteth downe he was informed the Turkes vſe to keepe grapes all the winter vnto the next ſummer) to take ſo much meale of Muſtard ſeede, as will ſerue to ſtrow vpon grapes, vntill they haue filled their veſſels, whereon afterwards they poure new wine before it hath boiled, to fill vp their veſſels therwith, and being ſtopped vp cloſe, they keepe them a certaine time, and ſelling them with their liquour to them that will
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:15790:284"/> vſe them, they doe waſh the ſeedes or meale from them when they vſe them. Another way is, that hauing gathered the faireſt ripe grapes, they are to be caſt vpon threds or ſtrings that are faſtened at both ends to the ſide walks of a chamber, neere vnto the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof, that no one bunch touch another, which will bee ſo kept a great while, yet the chamber muſt be well defended from the froſts, and cold windes that pierce in at the windowes, leſt they periſh the ſooner: and ſome will dippe the ends of the branches they hang vp firſt in molten pitch, thinking by ſearing vp the ends to keepe the bunches the better; but I doe not ſee any great likelihood therein. Your chamber or cloſet you appoint out for this purpoſe muſt alſo bee kept ſomewhat warme, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the more cold and froſtie time of the yeare, leſt it ſpoile all your coſt and paines, and fruſtrate you of all your hopes: but although the froſts ſhould pierce and ſpoile ſome of the grapes on a bunch, yet if you be carefull to keepe the place warme, the fewer will be ſpoiled. And thus haue I ſhewed you the beſt directions to order this Orchard rightly, and all the waies I know are vſed in our Countrie to keep grapes good anie long time after the gathering, in regard wee haue not that comfort of a hotter Sun to preſerue them by its heate.</p>

The white Raſpis is a little more pleaſant then the red, wherein there is ſmall ſeede incloſed: the rootes creepe vnder ground verie farre, and ſhoote vp againe in many places, much encreaſing thereby.</p>
                  <p>There is another whoſe ſtemme and branches are wholly without prickles: the fruit is red, and ſomewhat longer, and a little more ſharpe.</p>

                  <p>The red Curran buſh is of two ſorts, and groweth to the height of a man, hauing ſometimes a ſtemme of two inches thickneſſe, and diuers armes and branches, couered with a ſmooth, darke, browniſh barke, without anie pricke or thorne at all vpon anie part thereof, whereon doe growe large cornered blackiſh greene leaues, cut in on the edges, ſeeming to be made of fiue parts, almoſt like a Vine leafe, the ends a little poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, and ſtanding one aboue another on both ſides of the branches: the flowers are little and hollow, comming forth at the ioynts of the leaues, growing many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on a long ſtalke, hanging downe aboue a fingers length, and of an herbie colour: after which come ſmall round fruit or berries, greene at the firſt, and red as a Cherry when they are ripe, of a pleaſant and tart taſte: the other differeth not in anie other thing then in the berries, being twice as bigge as the former: the roote is wooddy, and ſpreadeth diuerſly.</p>

                  <p>WEe haue diuers ſorts of Gooſeberries, beſides the common kinde, which is of three ſorts, ſmall, great, and long. For wee haue three red Gooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, a blew and a greene.</p>
                  <p>The common Gooſeberrie, or Feaberrie buſh, as it is called in diuers Countries of England, hath oftentimes a great ſtemme, couered with a ſmooth darke coloured bark, without anie thorne thereon, but the elder branches haue here and there ſome on them, and the younger are whitiſh, armed with verie ſharpe and cruell crooked thorns, which no mans hand can well auoide that doth handle them, whereon are ſet verie greene and ſmall cornered leaues cut in, of the faſhion almoſt of Smallage, or Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne leaues, but broad at the ſtalke: the flowers come forth ſingle, at euerie ioynt of the leafe one or two, of a purpliſh greene colour, hollow and turning vp the brims a little: the berries follow, bearing the flowers on the heads of them, which are of a pale greene at the firſt, and of a greeniſh yellow colour when they are ripe, ſtriped in diuers places, and cleare, almoſt tranſparent, in which the ſeede lyeth. In ſome theſe berries are ſmall and round; in others much greater; a third is great, but longer then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: all of them haue a pleaſant winie taſte, acceptable to the ſtomacke of anie (but the long kinde hath both the thicker skin, and the worſer taſte of the other) and none haue been diſtempered by the eating of them, that euer I could heare of.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of the red Gooſeberries is better knowne I thinke then the reſt, and by reaſon of the ſmall bearing not much regarded; the ſtemme is ſomewhat bigge, and couered with a ſmooth darke coloured barke, the younger branches are whiter, and without anie thorne or pricke at all, ſo long, weake, ſmall, and ſlender, that they lye vpon the ground, and will there roote againe: the leaues are like vnto the former Gooſeberries, but larger: the flowers and berries ſtand ſingle, and not manie to bee found anie yeare vpon them, but are ſomewhat long, and are as great as the ordinarie Gooſeberry, of a darke browniſh red colour, almoſt blackiſh when they are ripe, and of a ſweetiſh taſte, but without any great delight.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond red Gooſeberry riſeth vp with a more ſtraight ſtemme, couered with a browniſh barke; the young branches are ſtraight likewiſe, and whitiſh, and grow not ſo thicke vpon it as the former red kinde, and without any thorne alſo vpon them: the leaues are like vnto the former red, but ſmaller: the berries ſtand ſingly at the leaues as Gooſeberries doe, and are of a fine red colour when they are ripe, but change with ſtanding to be of a darker red colour, of the bigneſſe of the ſmall ordinary Gooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, of a pretty tart taſte, and ſomewhat ſweete withall.</p>
                  <p>The third red Gooſeberry which is the greateſt, and knowne but vnto few, is ſo like vnto the common great Gooſeberry, that it is hardly diſtinguiſhed: the fruit or berries grow as plentifully on the branches as the ordinary, and are as great &amp; round as the great ordinary kinde, but reddiſh, and ſome of them paler, with red ſtripes.</p>
                  <p>The blew Gooſeberry riſeth vp to bee a buſh like vnto the red Curran, and of the ſame bigneſſe and height, with broader and redder leaues at the firſt ſhooting out, then the ſecond red Gooſeberry: the berries are more ſparingly ſet on the branches, then on the ſmall red, and much about the ſame bigneſſe, or rather leſſer, of the colour of a Damſon, with an ouerſhadowing of a blewiſh colour vpon them, as the Damſon hath, before it be handled or wiped away.</p>

                  <p>THe Filberd tree that is planted in Orchards, is very like vnto the Haſell nut tree that groweth wilde in the woods, growing vpright, parted into many boughes and tough plyable twigges, without knots, couered with a browniſh, ſpeckled, ſmooth, thinne rinde, and greene vnderneath: the leaues are broad, large, wrinkled, and full of veines, cut in on the edges into deepe dents, but not into any gaſhes, of a darke greene colour on the vpperſide, and of a grayiſh aſh colour vnderneath: it hath ſmall and long catkins in ſtead of flowers, that come forth in the Winter, when as they are firme and cloſe, and in the Spring open themſelues ſomewhat more, growing longer, and of a browniſh yellow colour: the nuts come not vpon thoſe ſtalkes that bore thoſe catkins, but by themſelues, and are wholly incloſed in long, thicke, rough huskes, bearded as it were at the vpper ends, or cut into diuers long iagges, much more then the wood nut: the nut hath a thinne and ſomewhat hard ſhell, but not ſo thicke and hard as the wood nut, in ſome longer then in other, and in the long kinde, one hath the skinne white that couereth the kernels, and another red.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of the round kinde that came from Conſtantinople, whoſe huske is more cut, torne, or iagged, both aboue and belowe, then any of our country; the barke alſo is whiter, and more rugged then ours, and the leaues ſomewhat larger.</p>
                  <p>We haue had from Virginia Haſell nuts, that haue beene ſmaller, rounder, browner, thinner ſheld, and more pointed at the end then ours: I know not if any hath planted of them, or if they differ in leafe or any thing elſe.</p>

                     <hi>Vitis.</hi> The Vine.</head>
                  <p>THere is ſo great diuerſities of Grapes, and ſo conſequently of Vines that bear them, that I cannot giue you names to all that here grow with vs: for Iohn Tradeſcante my verie good friend, ſo often before remembred, hath aſſured me, that he hath twentie ſorts growing with him, that hee neuer knew how or by what name to call them. One deſcription therefore ſhall ſerue (as I vſe to doe in ſuch varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) for all the reſt, with the names afterwards, of as many as we can giue, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall formes, colours and proportions of the grapes.</p>
                  <p>The manured Vine, in the places where it hath abiden long time, groweth to haue a great bodie, ſtemme or trunke, ſometimes of the bigneſſe of a mans arme, ſleeue and all, ſpreading branches if it bee ſuffered without end or meaſure, but vſually ſtored with many armes or branches, both old and new, but weake, and therefore muſt bee ſuſtained; whereof the old are couered with a thin ſcaly rinde, which will often chap and peele off of it ſelfe; the youngeſt being of a reddiſh colour, ſmooth and firme, with a hollowneſſe or pith in the middle: from the ioints of the young branches, and ſometimes from the bodie of the elder, breake out on euerie ſide broade greene leaues, cut on the edges into fiue diuiſions for the moſt part, and beſides notched or den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about: right againſt the leafe, and likewiſe at other ioynts of the branches, come forth long twining or claſping tendrels, winding themſelues about any thing ſtandeth next vnto them: at the bottome of theſe leaues come forth cluſters of ſmall greeniſh yellow bloomes or flowers, and after them the berries, growing in the ſame manner in cluſters, but of diuers formes, colours, taſtes and greatneſſe. For ſome grapes are great, others leſſe, ſome very ſmall (as the Currans that the Grocers ſell) ſome white, ſome red, blew, blacke, or partie-coloured, ſome are are as it were ſquare, others round: ſome the cluſters are cloſe, others open, ſome are ſweete, others ſower or harſh, or of ſome other mixed taſte; euerie one differing from others, verie notably either in taſte, colour or forme; within euerie one of which grapes, (and yet there is a grape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtones) are contained one, two, or more kernels or ſtones, ſome of them being ſmal, others greater: the rootes ſpread far and deepe. They that keepe their Vines in the beſt order, doe cut them low, not ſuffering them to grow high, or with too many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereby they grow the better, take vp the leſſer roome, and bring their grapes fairer and ſweeter.</p>

                     <head>The kinds of Vines and Grapes.</head>
                     <p>Our ordinarie Grape both white and red, which excelleth Crabs for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuice, and is not fit for wine with vs.</p>
                     <p>The white Muſcadine Grape is a verie great Grape, ſweete and firme, ſome of the bunches haue weighed ſixe pound, and ſome of the grapes halfe an ounce.</p>
                     <p>The redde Muſcadine is as great as the white, and chiefly differeth in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>The Burlet is a very great white Grape, but fitter for veriuice then wine for the moſt part; yet when a hot yeare happeneth fit for it, the Grape is pleaſant.</p>
                     <p>The little blacke Grape that is ripe very early.</p>
                     <p>The Raiſin of the Sunne Grape is a very great Grape, and very great clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, of a reddiſh colour when it is ripe with vs, yet in an extraordinarie hot yeare, it hath got a little blewneſſe caſt ouer it by the heat: but naturally verie blew.</p>
                     <p>The Curran Grape (or the Grape of Corinth) is the leaſt Grape of all, and beareth both few, and verie ſeldome with vs, but in reaſonable great cluſters, and of a blackiſh blew colour, when they are ripe with vs, and very <pb n="564" facs="tcp:15790:289"/> ſweete. There is another ſort of them that are red or browne, and of a ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er taſte, nothing ſo ſweete.</p>
                     <p>The Greeke wine Grape is a blackiſh Grape, and very ſweete.</p>
                     <p>The Frontignack is a white Grape, of a verie ſweete and delicate taſte, as the wine declareth, that ſmelleth as it were of Muske.</p>
                     <p>The ſquare Grape is reported to bear a Grape not fully round, but ſided, or as it were ſquare, whereby it became ſo called.</p>
                     <p>The Damaſco Grape is a great white grape, very ſweete, and is the true <hi>Vva Zibeba,</hi> that the Apothecaries ſhould vſe in the <hi>Trochiſci Ciphi:</hi> and ſuch wee haue had in former times come ouer vnto vs in great, long and round white boxes, containing halfe an hundred weight a peece.</p>
                     <p>The Ruſſet Grape is a reaſonable faire grape, exceeding ſweet and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, with a thicke skinne, cruſted ouer with a ſhew of aſh colour.</p>
                     <p>The white long Grape is like vnto a Pigeons egge, or as it were pointed pendent like a Pearle.</p>
                     <p>The partie-coloured Grape is a reaſonable great Grape, and diſcoloured when it is ripe, ſometimes the whole bunches, and ſometimes but ſome of the grapes being parted whitiſh, and blacke halfe through, verie variably.</p>
                     <p>The Rheniſh wine Grape is a white Grape, and endureth the cold of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when it commeth earely, more then the Muſcadine before ſet downe, and is nothing ſo ſweete.</p>
                     <p>The White wine Grape is verie like vnto the Rhine Grape, the ſoile only and climate adding more ſweetneſſe vnto the one then to the other.</p>
                     <p>The Claret wine Grape is altogether like the white Grape, but that it is not white, but of a reddiſh colour, which lying bruiſed vpon the skins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are preſſed, giue that Claret tincture to the wine.</p>
                     <p>The Teint is a Grape of a deeper or darker colour, whoſe iuice is of ſo deepe a colour, that it ſerueth to colour other wine.</p>
                     <p>The Burſarobe is a faire ſweete white Grape of much eſteeme about Paris.</p>
                     <p>The Alligant is a verie ſweete Grape, giuing ſo deep and liuely a coloured red wine, that no other whatſoeuer is comparable to it, and therfore vſually called Spaniards blood.</p>
                     <p>The blew or blacke Grape of Orleans is another blacke Grape, giuing a darke coloured ſweete wine much commended in thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>The Grape without ſtones is alſo a kinde by it ſelfe, and groweth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neere Aſcalon, as Brochard affirmeth, the wine whereof is redde, and of a good taſte.</p>
                     <p>The Virginia Vine, whereof I muſt needes make mention among other Vines, beareth ſmall Grapes without any great ſtore of iuice therein, and the ſtone within it bigger then in any other Grape: naturally it runneth on the ground, and beareth little.</p>

                     <p>The iuice or veriuice that is made of greene hard grapes, before they be ripe, is vſed of the Apothecaries to be made into a Syrupe, that is very good to coole and refreſh a faint ſtomacke.</p>
                     <p>And being made of the riper grapes is the beſt veriuice, farre exceeding that which is made of crabs, to be kept all the yeare, to be put both into meates and medicines.</p>
                     <p>The grapes of the beſt ſorts of Vines are preſſed into wine by ſome in theſe dayes with vs, and much more as I verily beleeue in times paſt, as by the name of Vineyard giuen to many places in this Kingdome, eſpecially where Abbies and Monaſteries ſtood, may bee coniectured: but the wine of late made hath beene but ſmall, and not durable, like that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from beyond Sea, whether our vnkindly yeares, or the want of skill, or a conuenient place for a Vineyard be the cauſe, I cannot well tell you.</p>
                     <p>Grapes of all ſorts are familiarly eaten when they are ripe, of the ſicke ſometimes as well as the ſound.</p>
                     <p>The dryed grapes which we call great Rayſins, and the Currans which we call ſmall Rayſins, are much vſed both for meates, broths, and ſawces, in diuers manners, as this Countrey in generall aboue any other, wherein many thouſands of Frailesfull, Pipes, Hogs-heads, and Buts full are ſpent yearly, that it breedeth a wonder in them of thoſe parts where they growe and prouide them, how we could ſpend ſo many.</p>
                     <p>The Rayſins of the Sunne are the beſt dryed grapes, next vnto the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſco, and are very wholſome to eate faſting, both to nouriſh, and to helpe to looſen the belly.</p>
                     <p>The dryed Lees of wine called Argoll or Tartar, is put to the vſe of the Goldſmith, Dyer, and Apothecary, who doe all vſe it in ſeuerall manners, uery one in his art.</p>
                     <p>Of it the Apothecaries make <hi>Cremer Tartari,</hi> a fine medicine to bee vſed, as the Phyſitian can beſt appoint, and doth helpe to purge humours by the ſtoole.</p>
                     <p>Thereof likewiſe they make a kinde of water or oyle, fit to bee vſed, to take away freckles, ſpots, or any ſuch deformities of the face or skinne, and to make it ſmooth. It cauſeth likewiſe haire to growe more aboundantly in thoſe places where it naturally ſhould growe.</p>
                     <p>The liquor of the Vine that runneth forth when it is cut, is commended to be good againſt the ſtone whereſoeuer it be; but that liquor that is taken from the end of the branches when they are burnt, is moſt effectuall to take away ſpots and markes, ring-wormes and tetters in any place.</p>

                  <p>THe Figge trees that are nourſed vp in our country are of three ſorts, whereof two are high; the one bearing againſt a wall goodly ſweete and delicate Figs, called Figs of Algarua, and is blewiſh when it is ripe: the other tall kinde is nothing ſo good, neither doth beare ripe Figges ſo kindly and well, and peraduenture may be the white ordinary kinde that commeth from Spaine. The third is a dwarfe kinde of Figge tree, not growing much higher then to a mans body or ſhoulders, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring excellent good Figges and blew, but not ſo large as the firſt kinde.</p>
                  <p>The Figge trees of all theſe three kindes are in leaues and growing one like vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſauing for their height, colour, and ſweetneſſe of the fruit, hauing many armes or branches, hollow or pithy in the middle, bearing very large leaues, and ſomewhat thicke, diuided ſometimes into three, but vſually into fiue ſections, of a darke greene colour on the vpperſide, and whitiſh vnderneath, yeelding a milkie iuyce when it is <pb n="567" facs="tcp:15790:290"/> broken, as the branches alſo or the figges when they are greene: the fruit breaketh out from the branches without anie bloſſome, contrary to all other trees of our Orchard, being round and long, faſhioned very like vnto a ſmall Peare, full of ſmall white grains or kernels within it, of a very ſweete taſte when it is ripe, and very mellow or ſoft, that it can hardly be carried farre without bruiſing.</p>
                  <p>The other two ſorts you may eaſily know and vnderſtand, by ſo much as hath been ſaid of them. Take only this more of the Figge tree, That if you plant it not againſt a bricke wall, or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l of an houſe, &amp;c. it will not ripen ſo kindly. The dwarfe Figge tree is more tender, and is therefore planted in great ſquare tubs, to be remoued into the ſunne in the Summer time, and into the houſe in Winter.</p>

<hi>Aria Theophrasti,</hi> whole leaues are large, ſomewhat like Nut tree leaues, but greene aboue, and grayiſh vnderneath: ſome doe vſe the fruit as Seruices, and for the ſame purpoſes to good effect, yet both of theſe wilde kindes wee leaue for another worke, and here declare vnto you onely thoſe two ſorts are nourſed vp in our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards.</p>
                  <p>The more common or ordinary Seruice tree with vs, is a reaſonable great tree, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with a ſmooth barke, ſpread into many great armes, whereon are ſet large leaues, very much cut in on the edges, almoſt like vnto a Vine leafe, or rather like vnto that kind of Maple, that is vſually called the Sycomore tree with vs: the flowers are white, and growe many cluſtering together, which after bring forth ſmall browne berries when they are ripe, of the bigneſſe almoſt of Haſell nuts, with a ſmall tuft, as if it were a crowne on the head, wherein are ſmall blacke kernels.</p>
                  <p>The other kinde, which is more rare with vs, and brought into this Land by Iohn Tradeſcante, heretofore often remembred, hath diuers winged leaues, many ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like vnto an Aſhen leafe, but ſmaller, and euery one endented about the edges: the flowers growe in long cluſters, but nothing ſo many, or ſo cloſe ſet as the wilde kinde: the fruit of this tree is in ſome round like an Apple, and in others a little longer
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:15790:291"/> like a Peare, but of a more pleaſant taſte then the ordinarie kinde, when they are ripe and mellowed, as they vſe to doe with both theſe kindes, and with Medlars.</p>

                  <p>The great and the ſmall Engliſh Medlar differ not one from the other in any thing, but in the ſize of the fruit, except that the ſmall kinde hath ſome prickes or thornes vpon it, which the great one hath not, bearing diuers boughes or armes, from whence breake forth diuers branches, whereon are ſet long and ſomewhat narrow leaues, many ſtanding together; in the middle whereof, at the end of the branch, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the flower, which is great and white, made of fiue leaues, broad at the ends, with a nicke in the middle of euery one; after which commeth the fruit, being round, and of a pale browniſh colour, bearing a crowne of thoſe ſmall leaues at the toppe, which were the huske of the flower before, the middle thereof being ſomewhat hollow, and is harſh, able to choake any that ſhall eate it before it be made mellow, wherein there are certaine flat and hard kernels.</p>
                  <p>The Medlar of Naples groweth likewiſe to bee a reaſonable great tree, ſpreading forth armes and branches, whereon are ſet many gaſhed leaues, ſomewhat like vnto Hawthorne leaues, but greater, and likewiſe diuers thornes in many places: the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are of an herbie greene colour, and ſmall, which turne into ſmaller fruit then the former, and rounder alſo, but with a ſmall head or crowne at the toppe like vnto it, and is of a more ſweete and pleaſant taſte then the other, with three ſeeds only therein ordinarily.</p>

                  <p>The firſt or true Lote tree groweth to be a tree of a great height, whoſe bodie and elder branches are couered with a ſmooth darke greene barke, the leaues are ſomewhat rough in handling, of a darke greene colour, long pointed, and ſomewhat deepe den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about the edges, ſomewhat like vnto a Nettle leafe, and oftentimes growe yellow toward Autumne: the flowers ſtand here and there ſcattered vpon the branches; after which come round berries like vnto Cherries, hanging downewards vpon long foot-ſtalkes, greene at the firſt, and whitiſh afterwards; but when they are ripe they become reddiſh, and if they be ſuffered to hang too long on the branches, they grow blackiſh, of a pleaſant auſtere taſte, not to be miſliked, wherein is a hard round ſtone.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, which is a baſtard kinde, and called
<hi>Guatacum Pataninum,</hi> groweth to bee a faire tree, with a ſmooth darke greene barke, ſhooting out many faire great boughes, and alſo ſlender greene branches, beſet with faire broad greene leaues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like vnto the leaues of the Cornell tree, but larger: the flowers growe along the branches cloſe vnto them, without any or with a very ſhort foote-ſtalke conſiſting of foure greene leaues, which are as the huske, containing within it a purpliſh flower, made of foure leaues ſomewhat reddiſh: the fruit ſtandeth in the middle of the green huske, greene at the firſt, and very harſh, but red and round when it is ripe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a Plumme, with a ſmall point or pricke at the head thereof, and of a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſant taſte or relliſh, wherein are contained flat and thicke browne ſeeds or ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, like vnto the kernels of <hi>Caſsia Fistula,</hi> ſomewhat hard, and not ſo ſtonie, but that it may ſomewhat eaſily be cut with a knife.</p>
                  <p>The third is called in Virginia <hi>Piſhamin,</hi> The Virginia Plumme (if it be not all one with the former Guaiacana, whereof I am more then halfe perſwaded) hath growne with vs of the kernels that were ſent out of Virginia, into great trees, whoſe wood is very hard and brittle, and ſomewhat white withall: the branches are many, and grow ſlender to the end, couered with a very thinne greeniſh bark, whereon doe grow many faire broad greene leaues, without dent or notch on the edges, and ſo like vnto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> that I verily thinke it (as I before ſaid) to bee the ſame. It hath not yet borne flower or fruit in our Countrey that I can vnderſtand: but the fruit, as it was ſent to vs, is in forme and bigneſſe like vnto a Date, couered with a blackiſh skinne, ſet in a huske of foure hard leaues, very firme like vnto a Date, and almoſt as ſweete, with great flat and thicke kernels within them, very like vnto the former, but larger.</p>

                  <p>THe Cornell tree that is planted in Orchards, being the male (for the female is an hedge buſh) is of two ſorts, the one bearing red, the other whiter berries, which is very rare yet in our country, and not differing elſe.</p>
                  <p>It groweth to a reaſonable bigneſſe and height, yet neuer to any great tree, the wood whereof is very hard, like vnto horne, and thereof it obtained the name: the body and branches are couered with a rugged barke, and ſpreadeth reaſonable well, hauing ſomewhat ſmooth leaues, full of veines, plaine, and not dented on the edges: the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are many ſmall yellow tufts, as it were of ſhort haires or threads ſet together, which come forth before any leafe, and fall away likewiſe before any leafe bee much open: the fruit are long and round berries, of the bigneſſe of ſmall Oliues, with an <pb n="571" facs="tcp:15790:292"/> hard round ſtone within them, like vnto an Oliue ſtone, and are of a yellowiſh red when they are ripe, of a reaſonable pleaſant taſte, yet ſomewhat auſtere withall.</p>
                  <p>The white (as I ſaid) is like vnto the red, but onely that his fruit is more white when it is ripe.</p>

                     <hi>Ceraſus.</hi> The Cherry tree.</head>
                  <p>THere are ſo many varieties and differences of Cherries, that I know not well how to expreſſe them vnto you, without a large relation of their ſeuerall formes. I will therefore endeauour after one generall deſcription (as my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is in many other the like variable fruits) to giue as briefe and ſhort notes vpon all the reſt, as I can both for leafe and fruit, that ſo you may the better know what the fruit is, when you haue the name.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh Cherrie tree groweth in time to be of a reaſonable bigneſſe and height, ſpreading great armes, and alſo ſmall twiggy branches plentifully; the leaues whereof are not varie large or long, but nicked or dented about the edges: the flowers come forth two or three or foure at the moſt together, at a knot or ioynt, euerie one by it ſelfe, vpon his owne ſmall and long footeſtalke, conſiſting of fiue white leaues, with ſome threds in the middle; after which come round berries, greene at the firſt, and red when they are through ripe, of a meane bigneſſe, and of a pleaſant ſweete taſte, ſomew hat tart withall, with a hard white ſtone within it, whoſe kernell is ſomewhat bitter, but not vnpleaſant.</p>
                  <p>The Flanders Cherrie differeth not from the Engliſh, but that it is ſomewhat larger, and the Cherry ſomewhat greater and ſweeter, and not ſo ſower.</p>
                  <p>The early Flanders Cherry is more rathe or early ripe, almoſt as ſoone as the May Cherry, eſpecially planted againſt a wall, and of many falſe knaues or Gardiners are ſold for May Cherrie trees.</p>
                  <p>The May Cherrie in a ſtandard beareth ripe fruite later then planted againſt a wall, where the berries will be red in the verie beginning of May ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Dukes Cherrie is one of the faireſt and beſt cherries wee haue, being of a very red colour when it is ripe, and a little long more then round, and ſomewhat poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the end, of the beſt relliſh of any Cherrie whatſoeuer, and of a firme ſubſtance; ſcarce one of twentie of our Nurſerie men doe ſell the right, but giue one for another: for it is an inherent qualitie almoſt hereditarie with moſt of them, to ſell any man an ordinary fruit for whatſoeuer rare fruit he ſhall aske for: ſo little they are to be truſted.</p>
                  <p>The ounce Cherrie hath the greateſt and broadeſt leafe of any other cherrie, but beareth the ſmalleſt ſtore of cherries euerie yeare that any doth, and yet bloſſometh well: the fruit alſo is nothing anſwerable to the name being not verie great, of a pale yellowiſh red, neere the colour of Amber, and therefore ſome haue called it, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Cherrie.</p>
                  <p>The great leafed Cherrie is thought of diuers to bee the Ounce Cherrie, becauſe it hath almoſt as great a leafe as the former: but the fruit of this alſo doth not anſwer the expectation of ſo great a leafe, being but of a meane bigneſſe, and a ſmall bearer, yet of a pale reddiſh colour.</p>
                  <p>The true Gaſcoign Cherry is known but to a few; for our Nurſery men do ſo change the names of moſt fruits they ſell, that they deliuer but very few true names to any: In former times before our wilde blacke Cherrie was found to grow plentifully in our owne woods in many places of this Land, the French continually ſtored vs with wilde ſtockes to graft vpon, which then were called Gaſcoigne ſtocks, but ſince they haue ſo
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:15790:293"/> termed another red Cherrie, and obtruded it vpon their cuſtomers: but the true is one of our late ripe white Cherries, euen as Gerard ſaith, it is a great cherrie and ſpotted: and this is that Cherrie I ſo commend to be a fit ſtocke to graft May cherries vpon.</p>
                  <p>The Morello Cherrie is of a reaſonable bigneſſe, of a darke red colour when they are full ripe, and hang long on, of a ſweetiſh ſower taſte, the pulpe or ſubſtance is red, and ſomewhat firme: if they be dryed they will haue a fine ſharpe or ſower taſte very delectable.</p>
                  <p>The Hartlippe Cherrie is ſo called of the place where the beſt of this kinde is nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp, being betweene Sitting bourne and Chattam in Kent, and is the biggeſt of our Engliſh kindes.</p>
                  <p>The ſmaller Lacure or Hart Cherrie is a reaſonable faire Cherrie, full aboue, and a little pointing downward, after the faſhion of an heart, as it is vſually painted, blackiſh when it is full ripe, and leſſer then the next.</p>
                  <p>The great Lacure or Hart Cherrie differeth not in forme, but in greatneſſe, being v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually twice as great as the former, and of a reddiſh blacke colour alſo: both of them are of a firme ſubſtance, and reaſonable ſweete. Some doe call the white cherrie, the White hart cherrie.</p>
                  <p>The Luke Wardes Cherrie hath a reaſonable large leafe, and a larger flower then many other: the cherries grow with long ſtalkes, and a ſtone of a meane ſize within them, of a darke reddiſh colour when they are full ripe, of a reaſonable good relliſh, and beareth well.</p>
                  <p>The Corone Cherrie hath a leafe little differing from the Luke Wardes cherrie; the fruit when it is ripe, is of a faire deepe red colour, of a good bigneſſe, and of a verie good taſte, neither verie ſweete or ſower: the pulpe or iuice will ſtaine the hands.</p>
                  <p>The Vrinall Cherrie in a moſt fruitfull yeare is a ſmall bearer, hauing many yeares none, and the beſt but a few; yet doth bloſſome plentifully euery yeare for the moſt part: the cherrie is long and round, like vnto an Vrinall, from whence it tooke his name; reddiſh when it is full ripe, and of an indifferent ſweete relliſh.</p>
                  <p>The Agriot Cherrie is but a ſmall Cherrie, of a deepe redde colour when it is ripe, which is late; of a fine ſharpe taſte, moſt pleaſant and wholſome to the ſtomacke of all other cherries, as well while they are freſh as being dryed, which manner they much vſe in France, and keepe them for the vſe both of the ſicke and ſound at all times.</p>
                  <p>The Biguarre Cherrie is a fair cherrie, much ſpotted with white ſpots vpon the pale red berry, and ſometimes diſcoloured halfe white and halfe reddiſh, of a reaſonable good relliſh.</p>
                  <p>The Morocco Cherrie hath a large white bloſſome, and an indifferent big berrie, long and round, with a long ſtalke of a darke reddiſh purple colour, a little tending to a blew when it is full ripe, of a firme ſubſtance: the iuice is of a blackiſh red, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring the hands or lips, and of a pleaſant taſte: Some doe thinke that this and the Morello be both one.</p>
                  <p>The Naples Cherrie is alſo thought to bee all one with the Morello or Morocco.</p>
                  <p>The white Spaniſh Cherrie is an indifferent good bearer, the leafe and bloſſome ſomewhat large, and like the Luke Wardes cherrie: the cherries are reaſonable faire berries, with long ſtalkes and great ſtones, white on the outſide, with ſome redneſſe, on the one ſide of a firme ſubſtance, and reaſonable ſweet, but with a little aciditie, and is one of the late ripe ones: But there is another late ripe white Cherry, which ſome call the Gaſcoigne, before remembred.</p>
                  <p>The Flanders cluſter Cherrie is of two ſorts, one greater then another: the greater kinde hath an indifferent large leafe; the bloſſomes haue many threds within them, ſhewing as it were many parts, which after turne into cluſters of berries, foure, fiue or ſixe together, and but with one ſtalke vnder them, as if they grew one out of another, and ſometimes they will beare but two or three, and moſt of them but one cherry on a ſtalke, which are red when they are ripe, very tender, and wateriſh ſweete in eating.</p>
                  <p>The leſſer is in all things like the greater, but ſmaller, which maketh the difference.</p>
                  <p>The wilde cluſter or birds cluſter Cherry beareth many bloſſomes ſet all along the ſtalkes, and cherries after them in the ſame maner, like long thinne bunch of grapes, and therefore called of ſome the Grape cherry: there are of them both red and blacke.</p>

                     <pb n="574" facs="tcp:15790:294"/>The ſoft ſheld Cherrie is a ſmall red cherrie when it is ripe, hauing the ſtone within it ſo ſoft and tender, that it may eaſily be broken in the eating of the cherrie.</p>
                  <p>Iohn Tradeſcantes Cherrie is moſt vſually ſold by our Nurſery Gardiners, for the Archdukes cherrie, becauſe they haue more plenty thereof, and will better be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and becauſe it is ſo faire and good a cherrie that it may be obtruded without much diſcontent: it is a reaſonable good bearer, a faire great berrie, deepe coloured, and a little pointed.</p>
                  <p>The Baccalaos or New-found-land Cherrie hath a ſhining long leafe, moſt like vnto a Peach leaſe, the bloſſomes come very many together as it werein an vmbell, which is ſuch a cluſter as is neither like the Flanders cluſter, nor the wilde cluſter cherrie bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: it bringeth forth berries ſtanding in the ſame manner euerie one vpon his own footeſtalke, being no bigger then the largeſt berrie of the red Curran tree or buſh, of a pale or wateriſh red colour when it is ripe.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrange long cluſter Cherrie, or <hi>Padus Theophrasti Dalechampio</hi> is reckoned by the Author of that great Herball that goeth vnder his name, among the ſorts of cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and ſo muſt I vntill a fitter place be found for it. It groweth in time to be a great tree, with a ſad coloured barke both on the bodie and branches, whereon doe grow many leaues, ſomewhat broade, ſhorter, harder, and a little more crumpled then any cherrie leafe: the bloſſomes are very ſmall, and of a pale or whitiſh colour, ſmelling very ſweete and ſtrong, or rather heady, like Orenge flowers, growing on ſmall long branches, very like the toppe of flowers vpon the Laburnum or Beane trefoile trees: after which come ſmall blacke berries, growing together all along the long ſtalke, like vnto the wilde cluſter or birds cherrie mentioned before, but not much bigger then tares, with ſmall ſtones within them, and little or no ſuſtance vpon them: the French call the tree <hi>Putier,</hi> becauſe the wood thereof ſtinketh, and make it to be wonderfull that the bloſſomes of the tree ſhould be ſo ſweete, and the wood ſo ſtinking.</p>
                  <p>The Cullen Cherrie is a darke red cherrie like the Agriot, which they of thoſe parts neere Cullen and Vtrecht &amp;c. vſe to put into their drinke, to giue it the deeper colour.</p>
                  <p>The great Hungarian Cherrie of Zwerts is like both in leafe and fruite vnto the Morello cherrie, but much greater and fairer, and a far better bearer: for from a ſmall branch hath beene gathered a pound of cherries, and this is vſuall continually, and not accidentally, moſt of them foure inches in compaſſe about, and very many of them more of a faire deepe red colour, and very ſweete, excelling the Arch-Dukes cherry, or any other whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>The Cameleon or ſtrange changeable Cherry deſeruedly hath this name, although of mine owne impoſition, not only becauſe it beareth vſually both bloſſomes, greene and ripe fruit at one time thereupon, but that the fruit will be of many formes; ſome round, ſome as it were ſquare, and ſome bunched forth on one ſide or another, abiding conſtant in no faſhion, but for the moſt part ſhewing forth all theſe diuerſities euerie yeare growing vpon it: the fruit is of a very red colour, and good taſte.</p>
                  <p>The great Roſe Cherry, or double bloſſomd Cherry differeth not in anything from the Engliſh Cherrie, but only in the bloſſomes, which are very thicke of white leaues, as great and double as the double white Crowfoote, before remembred, and ſomtimes out of the middle of them will ſpring another ſmaller flower, but double alſo; this ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome beareth fruit, but when it doth I ſuppoſe it commeth from thoſe bloſſomes are the leaſt double, and is red, no bigger then our ordinary Engliſh cherrie.</p>
                  <p>The leſſer Roſe or double bloſſomd Cherrie beareth double flowers alſo, but not ſo thicke and double as the former; but beareth fruit more plentifully, of the ſame colour and bigneſſe with the former.</p>
                  <p>The Dwarfe Cherrie is of two ſorts; one whoſe branches fall downe low, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the body of it, with ſmall greene leaues, and fruit as ſmall, of a deep red colour.</p>

                  <p>The great bearing Cherry of Maſter Millen is a reaſonable great red cherry, bearing very plentifully, although it bee planted againſt a North wall, yet it will bee late ripe, but of an indifferent ſweet and good relliſh.</p>

                  <p>THere are many more varieties of Plummes then of Cherries, ſo that I muſt follow the ſame order with theſe that I did with them, euen giue you their names apart, with briefe notes vpon them, and one deſcription to ſerue for all the reſt.

                  <p>The Plum tree (eſpecially diuers of them) riſeth in time to bee a reaſonable tall and great tree, whoſe bodie and greater armes are couered with a more rugged barke, yet in ſome more or leſſe, the younger branches being ſmooth in all, the leaues are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rounder then thoſe of the Cherrie tree, and much differing among themſelues, ſome being longer, or larger, or rounder then others, and many that are exerciſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, can tell by the leafe what Plum the tree beareth (I ſpeake this of many, not of all) as in many Cherries they can doe the like: the flowers are white, conſiſting of fiue leaues: the fruit is as variable in forme, as in taſte or colour, ſome being ovall or Peare faſhion or Almond like, or ſphericall or round, ſome firme, ſome ſoft and wateriſh, ſome ſweete, ſome ſower or harſh, or differing from all theſe taſtes: and ſome white, others blacke, ſome red, others yellow, ſome purple, others blew, as they ſhall bee briefly ſet downe vnto you in the following lines, where I meane not to inſert any the wilde or hedge fruit, but thoſe only are fit for an Orchard, to be ſtored with good fruit: and of all which ſorts, the choyſeſt for goodneſſe, and rareſt for knowledge, are to be had of my very good friend Maſter Iohn Tradeſcante, who hath wonderfully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to obtaine all the rareſt fruits hee can heare off in any place of Chriſtendome, Turky, yea or the whole world; as alſo with Maſter Iohn Millen, dwelling in Olde ſtreete, who from Iohn Tradeſcante and all others that haue had good fruit, hath ſtored himſelfe with the beſt only, and he can ſufficiently furniſh any.</p>

                  <p>The Amber plum is a round plum, as yellow on the outſide almoſt as yellow waxe, of a ſowre vnpleaſant taſte that which I taſted, but I thinke it was not the right; for I haue ſeene and taſted another of the ſame bigneſſe, of a paler colour, farre better relli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and a firmer ſubſtance, comming cleane from the ſtone like an Apricocke.</p>
                  <p>The Apricocke plum is a good plum when it is in its perfection, but that is ſeldome; for it doth moſt vſually cracke, thereby diminiſhing much of its goodneſſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides yeeldeth gumme at the crackes.</p>

                  <p>The great Damſon or Damaske plum is greater then the ordinary Damſon, and ſweeter in taſte.</p>

                  <p>The green Oyſterly plum is a reaſonable great plum, of a whitiſh green colour when it is ripe, of a moiſt and ſweete taſte, reaſonable good.</p>
                  <p>The red Mirobalane plum groweth to be a great tree quickly, ſpreading very thicke and farre, very like the blacke Thorne or Sloe buſh: the fruit is red, earlier ripe, and of a better taſte then the white.</p>
                  <p>The white Mirobalane plum is in moſt things like the former red, but the fruit is of a whitiſh yellow colour, and very pleaſant, eſpecially if it be not ouer ripe: both theſe had need to be plaſhed againſt a wall, or elſe they will hardly beare ripe fruit.</p>
                  <p>The Oliue plum is very like a greene Oliue, both for colour and bigneſſe, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth lowe on a ſmall buſhing tree, and ripeneth late, but is the beſt of all the ſorts of greene plums.</p>
                  <p>The white diapred plum of Malta, ſcarce knowne to any in our Land but Iohn Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcante, is a very good plum, and ſtriped all ouer like diaper, and thereby ſo called.</p>

                  <p>THe Apricocke (as I ſaid) is without queſtion a kinde of Plumme, rather then a Peach, both the flower being white, and the ſtone of the fruit ſmooth alſo, like a Plumme, and yet becauſe of the excellencie of the fruit, and the difference therein from all other Plummes, I haue thought it meete to entreate thereof by it ſelfe, and ſhew you the varieties haue been obſerued in theſe times.</p>
                  <p>The Apricocke tree riſeth vp to a very great height, either ſtanding by it ſelfe (where it beareth not ſo kindly, and very little in our country) or planted againſt a wall, as it is moſt vſuall, hauing a great ſtemme or body, and likewiſe many great armes or branches, couered with a ſmooth barke: the leaues are large, broad, and almoſt round, but pointed at the ends, and finely dented about the edges: the flowers are white, as the Plumme tree bloſſomes, but ſomewhat larger, and rounder ſet: the fruit is round, with a cleft on the one ſide, ſomewhat like vnto a Peach, being of a yellowiſh colour as well on the inſide as outſide, of a firme or faſt ſubſtance, and dry, not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſt in the eating, and very pleaſant in taſte, containing within it a broad and flat ſtone, ſomewhat round and ſmooth, not rugged as the Peach ſtone, with a pleaſant ſweete kernell (yet ſome haue reported, that there is ſuch as haue their kernels bitter, which I did neuer ſee or know) and is ripe almoſt with our firſt or earlieſt Plummes, and thereof it tooke the name of <hi>Pracox;</hi> and it may bee was the earlieſt of all others was then knowne, when that name was giuen.</p>
                  <p>The great Apricocke, which ſome call the long Apricocke, is the greateſt and faireſt of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſmaller Apricocke, which ſome call the ſmall round Apricocke, is thought to be ſmall, becauſe it firſt ſprang from a ſtone: but that is not ſo; for the kinde it ſelfe being inoculated, will bee alwaies ſmall, and neuer halfe ſo faire and great as the former.</p>
                  <p>The white Apricocke hath his leaues more folded together, as if it were halfe dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: it beareth but ſeldome, and very few, which differ not from the ordinary, but in being more white, without any red when it is ripe.</p>
                  <p>The Maſcoline Apricocke hath a finer greene leafe, and thinner then the former, and beareth very ſeldome any ſtore of fruit, which differeth in nothing from the firſt, but that it is a little more delicate.</p>
                  <p>The long Maſcoline Apricocke hath his fruit growing a little longer then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and differeth in nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p>The Argier Apricocke is a ſmaller fruit then any of the other, and yellow, but as ſweete and delicate as any of them, hauing a blackiſh ſtone within it, little bigger then a Lacure Cherry ſtone: this with many other ſorts Iohn Tradeſcante brought with him returning from the Argier voyage, whither hee went voluntary with the Fleete, that went againſt the Pyrates in the yeare 1620.</p>

It ſooner waxeth old and decayeth, being ſprung of a ſtone, then being inoculated on a Plumme ſtocke, whereby it is more durable.</p>

                  <p>The Carnation Peach is of three ſorts, two are round, and the third long; they are all of a whitiſh colour, ſhadowed ouer with red, and more red on the ſide is next the ſunne: the leſſer round is the more common, and the later ripe.</p>
                  <p>The grand Carnation Peach is like the former round Peach, but greater, and is as late ripe, that is, in the beginning of September.</p>
                  <p>The red Peach is an exceeding well relliſhed fruit.</p>
                  <p>The ruſſet Peach is one of the moſt ordinary Peaches in the Kingdome, being of a ruſſet colour on the outſide, and but of a reaſonable relliſh, farre meaner then many other.</p>
                  <p>The Iſland Peach is a faire Peach, and of a very good relliſh.</p>
                  <p>The Newington Peach is a very good Peach, and of an excellent good relliſh, being of a whitiſh greene colour on the outſide, yet halfe reddiſh, and is ripe about Barthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew tide.</p>
                  <p>The yellow Peach is of a deepe yellow colour; there be hereof diuers ſorts, ſome good and ſome bad.</p>
                  <p>The St. Iames Peach is the ſame with the Queenes Peach, here belowe ſet downe, although ſome would make them differing.</p>
                  <p>The Melocotone Peach is a yellow faire Peach, but differing from the former yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low both in forme and taſte, in that this hath a ſmall crooked end or point for the moſt part, it is ripe before them, and better relliſhed then any of them.</p>

                  <p>The Nutmeg Peach is of two ſorts, one that will be hard when it is ripe, and eateth not ſo pleaſantly as the other, which will bee ſoft and mellow; they are both ſmall Peaches, hauing very little or no reſemblance at all to a Nutmeg, except in being a little longer then round, and are early ripe.</p>

                  <p>I Preſume that the name <hi>Nuciperſica,</hi> doth moſt rightly belong vnto that kinde of Peach, which we call Nectorins, and although they haue beene with vs not many yeares, yet haue they beene knowne both in Italy to Matthiolus, and others before him, who it ſeemeth knew no other then the yellow Nectorin, as Dalechampius alſo: But we at this day doe know fiue ſeuerall ſorts of Nectorins, as they ſhall be preſently ſet downe; and as in the former fruits, ſo in this, I will giue you the deſcription of one, and briefe notes of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Nectorin is a tree of no great bigneſſe, moſt vſually leſſer then the Peach tree, his body and elder boughes being whitiſh, the younger branches very red, whereon grow narrow long greene leaues, ſo like vnto Peach leaues, that none can well diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them, vnleſſe it be in this, that they are ſomewhat leſſer: the bloſſomes are all reddiſh, as the Peach, but one of a differing faſhion from all the other, as I ſhall ſhew you by and by: the fruit that followeth is ſmaller, rounder, and ſmoother then Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, without any cleft on the ſide, and without any douny cotton or freeze at all; and
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:15790:298"/> herein is like vnto the outer greene rinde of the Wallnut, whereof as I am perſwaded it tooke the name, of a faſt and firme meate, and very delicate in taſte, eſpecially the beſt kindes, with a rugged ſtone within it, and a bitter kernell.</p>
                  <p>The Muske Nectorin, ſo called, be cauſe it being a kinde of the beſt red Nectorins, both ſmelleth and eateth as if the fruit were ſteeped in Muske: ſome thinke that this and the next Romane Nectorin are all one.</p>
                  <p>The Romane red Nectorin, or cluſter Nectorin, hath a large or great purpliſh bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, like vnto a Peach, reddiſh at the bottome on the outſide, and greeniſh within: the fruit is of a fine red colour on the outſide, and groweth in cluſters, two or three at a ioynt together, of an excellent good taſte.</p>
                  <p>The baſtard red Nectorin hath a ſmaller or pincking bloſſome, more like threads then leaues, neither ſo large nor open as the former, and yellowiſh within at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome: the fruit is red on the outſide, and groweth neuer but one at a ioynt; it is a good fruit, but eateth a little more rawiſh then the other, euen when it is full ripe.</p>
                  <p>The yellow Nectorin is of two ſorts, the one an excellent fruit, mellow, and of a very good relliſh; the other hard, and no way comparable to it.</p>
                  <p>The greene Nectorin, great and ſmall; for ſuch I haue ſeene abiding conſtant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both planted in one ground: they are both of one goodneſſe, and accounted with moſt to be the beſtrelliſhed Nectorin of all others.</p>
                  <p>The white Nectorin is ſaid to bee differing from the other, in that it will bee more white on the outſide when it is ripe, then either the yellow or greene: but I haue not yet ſeene it.</p>

                  <p>The Almond tree groweth vpright, higher and greater then any Peach; and is therefore vſually planted by it ſelfe, and not againſt a wall, whoſe body ſometime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth any mans fadome, whereby it ſheweth to be of longer continuance, bearing large armes, and ſmaller branches alſo, but brittle, whereon are ſet long and narrow leaues, like vnto the Peach tree: the bloſſomes are purpliſh, like vnto Peach bloſoms, but paler: the fruit is ſomewhat like a Peach for the forme of the skinne or outſide, which is rough, but not with any ſuch cleft therein, or with any pulpe or meate fit to bee eaten, but is a thicke dry skinne when it is ripe, couering the ſtone or ſhell, which is ſmooth and not rugged, and is either long and great, or ſmall, or thicke and ſhort, according as the nut or kernell within it is, which is ſweete both in the greater and ſmaller, and onely one ſmaller kinde which is bitter: yet this I haue obſerued, that all the Almond trees that I haue ſeene growe in England, both of the ſweete and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kindes, beare Almonds thicke and ſhort, and not long, as that ſort which is called the Iorden Almond.</p>

                     <p>They are vſed many wayes, and for many purpoſes, either eaten alone with Figges, or Rayſins of the Sunne, or made into paſte with Sugar and Roſewater for Marchpanes, or put among Floure, Egges, and Sugar, to

                     <p>The oyle of bitter Almonds is much vſed to be dropped into their eares that are hard of hearing, to helpe to open them.

If therefore any be deſirous to keepe this tree, he muſt ſo prouide for it, that it be preſerued from any cold, either in the winter or ſpring, and expoſed to the comfort of the ſunne in ſummer. And for that purpoſe ſome keepe them in great ſquare boxes, and lift them to and fro by iron hooks on the ſides, or cauſe them to be rowled by trundels, or ſmall wheeles vnder them, to place them in an houſe, or cloſe gallerie for the winter time: others plant them againſt a bricke wall in the ground, and defend them by a ſhed of boardes, couered ouer with ſeare-cloth in the winter, and by the warmth of a ſtoue, or other ſuch thing, giue them ſome comfort in the colder times: but no tent or meane prouiſion will preſerue them.</p>
                  <p>The Orenge tree in the warme Countries groweth very high, but with vs (or elſe it is a dwarfe kinde there of) riſeth not very high: the barke of the elder ſtemmes being of a darke colour, and the young branches very greene, whereon grow here and there ſome few thornes: the leaues are faire, large, and very greene, in forme almoſt like a Bay leafe, but that it hath a ſmall eare, or peece of a leafe, faſhioned like vnto an heart vnder euery one of them, with many ſmall holes to be ſeene in them, if you hold them vp betweene you and the light, of a ſweet but ſtrong ſmell, naturally not falling away, but alwaies abiding on, or vntill new be come vp, bearing greene leaues continually: the flowers are whitiſh, of a very ſtrong and heady ſent; after which come ſmall round fruit, greene at the firſt, while they are ſmall, and not neere maturitie, but being grown and ripe, are (as all men know) red on the out ſide, ſome more pale then others, and ſome kindes of a deeper yellowiſh red, according to the climate, and as it receiueth the heate of the ſunne, wherein is contained ſower or ſweete iuice, and thicke white ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels among it: it beareth in the warme Countries both bloſſomes and greene fruit continually vpon it, and ripe fruit alſo with them for the beſt part of the yeare, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in Autumne and Winter.</p>

                  <p>THe ſorts of Apples are ſo many, and infinite almoſt as I may ſay, that I cannot giue you the names of all, though I haue endeauoured to giue a great many, and I thinke it almoſt impoſſible for any one, to attaine to the full perfection of knowledge herein, not onely in regard of the multiplicitie of faſhions, colours and taſtes, but in that ſome are more familiar to one Countrey then to another, being of a better or worſe taſte in one place then in another, and therefore diuerſly called: I will therefore as I haue done before, giue you the deſcription of the Tree in generall, as alſo of the Paradiſe or dwarfe Apple, becauſe of ſome eſpeciall difference, and afterwards the names of as many, with their faſhions, as haue come to my knowledge, either by ſight or relation: for I doe confeſſe I haue not ſeene all that I here ſet downe, but vſe the helpe of ſome friends, and therefore if it happen that the ſeuerall names doe not anſwer vnto ſeuerall ſorts, but that the ſame fruit may bee called by one name in one Country, that is called by another elſewhere, excuſe it I pray you; for in ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſuch a fault may eſcape vnknowne.</p>
                  <p>The Apple tree for the moſt part is neyther very high, great or ſtraight, but rather vſually boweth and ſpreadeth (although in ſome places it groweth fairer and ſtraighter then in others) hauing long and great armes or boughes, and from them ſmaller bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereon doe grow ſomewhat broade, and long greene leaues, nicked about the edges: the flowers are large and white, with bluſh coloured ſides, conſiſting of fiue leaues: the fruit (as I ſaid) is of diuers formes, colours and taſtes, and likewiſe of a very variable durabilitie; for ſome muſt be eaten preſently after they are gathered, and they are for the moſt part the earlieſt ripe; others will abide longer vpon the trees, before they bee fit to be gathered; ſome alſo will be ſo hard when others are gathered, that they will not be fit to be eaten, for one, two or three months after they bee gathered; and ſome will abide good but one, two or three moneths, and no more; and ſome will be beſt, after a quarter or halfe a yeares lying, vnto the end of that yeare or the next. The Paradiſe or dwarfe Apple tree groweth nothing ſo high as the former, and many times not much higher then a man may reach, hauing leaues and flowers altogether like the other, the fruit is a faire yellow Apple, and reaſonable great, but very light and ſpongy or looſe, and of a bitteriſh ſweet taſte, nothing pleaſant. And theſe faults al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <pb n="587" facs="tcp:15790:300"/> are incident vnto this tree, that both bodie and branches are much ſubiect vnto cancker, which will quickely eate it round, and kill it; beſides it will haue many bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or tuberous ſwellings in many places, which grow as it were ſcabby or tough, and will ſoone cauſe it to periſh: the roote ſendeth forth many ſhootes and ſuck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this benefit may be had of it, to recompence the former faults, That being a dwarfe Tree, whatſoeuer fruit ſhall bee grafted on it, will keepe the graft low like vnto it ſelfe, and yet beare fruit reaſonable well. And this is a pretty way to haue Pippins, Pomewaters, or any other ſort of Apples (as I haue had my ſelfe, and alſo ſeene with others) growing low, that if any will, they may make a hedge rowe of theſe low fruits, planted in an Orchard all along by a walke ſide: but take this Caueat, if you will auoide the danger of the cancker and knots, which ſpoile the tree, to graft it hard vnto the ground, that therby you may giue as little of the nature of the ſtock thereunto as poſſibly you can, which wil vndoubtedly help it very much.</p>

                     <p>The Summer pippin is a very good apple firſt ripe, and therefore to bee firſt ſpent, becauſe it will not abide ſo long as the other.</p>
                     <p>The French pippin is alſo a good fruit and yellow.</p>
                     <p>The Golding pippin is the greateſt and beſt of all ſorts of pippins.</p>
                     <p>The Ruſſet pippin is as good an apple as moſt of the other ſorts of pippins.</p>
                     <p>The ſpotted pippin is the moſt durable pippin of all the other ſorts.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary yellow pippin is like the other, and as good; for indeed I know no ſort of pippins but are excellent good well relliſhed fruites.</p>
                     <p>The great pearemaine differeth little either in taſte or durabilitie from the pippin, and therefore next vnto it is accounted the beſt of all apples.</p>
                     <p>The ſummer pearemaine is of equall goodneſſe with the former, or rather a little more pleaſing, eſpecially for the time of its eating, which will not bee ſo long laſting, but is ſpent and gone when the other beginneth to be good to eate.</p>
                     <p>The Ruſſetting is alſo a firme and a very good apple, not ſo wateriſh as the pippin or pearemaine, and will laſt the beſt part of the year, but will be very mellow at the laſt, or rather halfe dryed.</p>
                     <p>The Broading is a very good apple.</p>
                     <p>The Pomewater is an excellent good and great whitiſh apple, full of ſap or moiſture, ſomewhat pleaſant ſharpe, but a little bitter withall: it will not laſt long, the winter froſts ſoone cauſing it to rot, and periſh.</p>

                  <p>WEe haue ſome diuerſities of Quinces, although not many, yet more then our elder times were acquainted with, which ſhall be here expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>The Quince tree groweth oftentimes to the height and bigneſſe of a good Apple tree, but more vſually lower, with crooked and ſpreading armes and branches farre abroad, the leaues are ſomewhat round, and like the leaues of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tree, but thicker, harder, fuller of veines, and white on the vnderſide: the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes or flowers are white, now and then daſht ouer with bluſh, being large and open, like vnto a ſingle Roſe: the fruit followeth, which when it is ripe is yellow, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with a white cotton or freeze, which in the younger is thicker and more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but waxeth leſſe and leſſe, as the fruit ripeneth, being bunched out many times in ſeuerall places, and round, eſpecially about the head, ſome greater, others ſmaller, ſome round like an Apple, others long like a Peare, of a ſtrong heady ſent, accounted not wholſome or long to be endured, and of no durabilitie to keepe, in the middle whereof is a core, with many blackiſh ſeedes or kernels therein, lying cloſe together in cels, and compaſſed with a kinde of clearegelly, which is eaſier ſeene in the ſcalded fruit, then in the raw.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh Quince is the ordinarie Apple Quince, ſet downe before, and is of ſo harſh a taſte being greene, that no man can endure to eate it rawe, but eyther boyled, ſtewed, roaſted or baked; all which waies it is very good.</p>
                  <p>The Portingall Apple Quince is a great yellow Quince, ſeldome comming to bee whole and faire without chapping; this is ſo pleaſant being freſh gathered, that it may be eaten like vnto an Apple without offence.</p>
                  <p>The Portingall Peare Quince is not fit to be eaten rawe like the former, but muſt be vſed after ſome of the waies the Engliſh Quince is appointed, and ſo it will make more dainty diſhes then the Engliſh, becauſe it is leſſe harſh, will bee more tender, and take leſſe ſugar for the ordering then the Engliſh kinde.</p>
                  <p>The Barbary Quince is like in goodneſſe vnto the Portingall Quince laſt ſpoken of, but leſſer in bigneſſe.</p>

                     <p>There is no fruit growing in this Land that is of ſo many excellent vſes as this, ſeruing as well to make many diſhes of meate for the table, as for <pb n="590" facs="tcp:15790:302"/> banquets, and much more for the Phyſicall vertues, whereof to write at large is neither conuenient for mee, nor for this worke: I will onely briefly recite ſome, as it were to giue you a taſte of that plenty remaineth therein, to bee conuerted into ſundry formes: as firſt for the table, while they are freſh (and all the yeare long after being pickled vp) to be baked, as a dainty diſh, being well and orderly cookt. And being preſerued whole in Sugar, either white or red, ſerue likewiſe, not onely as an after diſh to cloſe vp the ſtomacke, but is placed among other Preſerues by Ladies and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and beſtowed on their friends to entertaine them, and among other ſorts of Preſerues at Banquets. Codiniacke alſo and Marmilade, Ielly and Paſte, are all made of Quinces, chiefly for delight and pleaſure, although they haue alſo with them ſome phyſicall properties.</p>
                     <p>We haue for the vſe of phyſicke, both Iuyce and Syrupe, both Conſerue and Condite, both binding and looſening medicines, both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and all made of Quinces.</p>
                     <p>The Ielly or Muccilage of the ſeedes, is often vſed to be laid vpon wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens breaſts, to heale them being ſore or rawe, by their childrens default giuing them ſucke.</p>
                     <p>Athenaeus reciteth in his third booke, that one Philarchus found, that the ſmell of Quinces tooke away the ſtrength of a certaine poiſon, called <hi>Phariacum.</hi> And the Spaniards haue alſo found, that the ſtrength of the iuyce of white Ellebor (which the Hunters vſe as a poyſon to dippe their arrow heads in, that they ſhoote at wilde beaſts to kill them) is quite taken away, if it ſtand within the compaſſe of the ſmell of Quinces.

                  <p>The Peare tree groweth more ſlowly, but higher, and more vpright then the apple tree, and not leſſe in the bulke of the body: his branches ſpread not ſo farre or wide, but growe vprighter and cloſer: the leaues are ſomewhat broader and rounder, greene aboue, and whiter vnderneath then thoſe of the apple tree: the flowers are whiter and greater: the fruit is longer then round for the moſt part, ſmaller at the ſtalke, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the head, of ſo many differing formes, colours, and taſtes, that hardly can one diſtinguiſh rightly between them, the times alſo being as variable in the gathering and ſpending of them, as in apples: the roote groweth deeper then the apple tree, and therefore abideth longer, and giueth a faſter, cloſer, &amp; ſmoother gentle wood, eaſie to be wrought vpon.</p>

                     <p>The Summer Bergomot is an excellent well relliſhed peare, flattiſh, &amp; ſhort, not long like others, of a meane bigneſſe, and of a darke yellowiſh greene colour on the outſide.</p>
                     <p>The Winter Bergomot is of two or three ſorts, being all of them ſmall fruit, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what greener on the outſide then the Summer kindes; all of them very delicate and good in their due time: for ſome will not be fit to bee eaten when others are will-nigh ſpent, euery of them outlaſting another by a moneth or more.</p>
                     <p>The Diego peare is but a ſmall peare, but an excellent well relliſhed fruit, taſting as if Maske had been put among it; many of them growe together, as it were in cluſters.</p>

                     <p>The greene Popperin is a winter fruit, of equall goodneſſe with the former.</p>
                     <p>The Soueraingne peare, that which I haue ſeene and taſted, and ſo termed vnto me, was a ſmall browniſh yellow peare, but of a moſt dainty taſte; but ſome doe take a kind of Bon Chretien, called the Elizabeth peare, to be the Soueraigne peare; how truely let others iudge.</p>

                     <p>The pound peare is a reaſonable good peare, both to eate rawe, and to bake.</p>
                     <p>The ten pound peare, or the hundred pound peare, the trueſt and beſt, is the beſt Bon Chretien of Syon, ſo called, becauſe the grafts coſt the Maſter ſo much the fetching by the meſſengers expences, when he brought nothing elſe.</p>

                     <p>The moſt excellent ſorts of Peares, ſerue (is I ſaid before of Apples) to <pb n="594" facs="tcp:15790:304"/> make an after-courſe for their maſters table, where the goodneſſe of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard is tryed. They are dryed alſo, and ſo are an excellent repaſte, if they be of the beſt kindes, fit for the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>They are eaten familiarly of all ſorts of people, of ſome for delight, and of others for nouriſhment, being baked, ſtewed, or ſcalded.</p>
                     <p>The red Warden and the Spaniſh Warden are reckoned among the moſt excellent of Peares, either to bake or to roaſt, for the ſicke or for the ſound: And indeede, the Quince and the Warden are the two onely fruits are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſicke, to eate at any time.</p>
                     <p>Perry, which is the iuyce of Peares preſſed out, is a drinke much eſteemed as well as Cyder, to be both drunke at home, and carried to the Sea, and found to be of good vſe in long voyages.</p>
                     <p>The Perry made of Choke Peares, notwithſtanding the harſhneſſe, and euill taſte, both of the fruit when it is greene, as alſo of the iuyce when it is new made, doth yet after a few moneths become as milde and pleaſant as wine, and will hardly bee knowne by the ſight or taſte from it: this hath beene found true by often experience; and therefore wee may admire the goodneſſe of God, that hath giuen ſuch facility to ſo wilde fruits, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought vſeleſſe, to become vſefull, and apply the benefit thereof both to the comfort of our ſoules and bodies.</p>
                     <p>For the Phyſicall properties, if we doe as Galen teacheth vs, <hi>in ſecundo Alimentorum,</hi> referre the qualities of Peares to their ſeuerall taſtes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had done in Apples, we ſhall not neede to make a new worke; thoſe that are harſh and ſowre doe coole and binde, ſweet do nouriſh and warme, and thoſe betweene theſe, to haue middle vertues, anſwerable to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Much more might be ſaid, both of this and the other kinds of fruits; but let this ſuffice for this place and worke, vntill a more exact be accompliſhed.</p>

                     <hi>Nux Iuglans.</hi> The Wallnut.</head>
                  <p>ALthough the Wallnut tree bee often planted in the middle of great Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, where by reaſon of his great ſpreading armes it taketh vp a great deale of roome, his ſhadow reaching farre, ſo that ſcarce any thing can well grow neare it; yet becauſe it is likewiſe planted in fit places or corners of Orchards, and that it beareth fruit or nuts, often brought to the table, eſpecially while they are freſheſt, ſweeteſt, and fitteſt to be eaten, let not my Orchard want his company, or you the knowledge of it. Some doe thinke that there are many ſorts of them, becauſe ſome are much greater then others, and ſome longer then others, and ſome haue a more fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible ſhell then others; but I am certainly perſwaded, that the ſoyle and climate where they grow, are the whole and onely cauſe of the varieties and differences. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Virginia hath ſent vnto vs two ſorts of Wallnuts, the one blacke, the other white, whereof as yet wee haue no further knowledge. And I know that Cluſius reporteth, he tooke vp at a banquet a long Wallnut, differing in forme and tenderneſſe of ſhell from others, which being ſet, grew and bore farre tenderer leaues then the other, and a little ſnipt about the edges, which (as I ſaid) might alter with the ſoyle and climate: and beſides you may obſerue, that many of Cluſius differences are very nice, and ſo I leaue it.</p>
                  <p>The Wallnut tree groweth very high and great, with a large and thicke body or trunke, couered with a thicke clouen whitiſh greene barke, tending to an aſh-colour; the armes are great, and ſpread farre, breaking out into ſmaller branches, whereon doe grow long &amp; large leaues, fiue or ſeuen ſet together one againſt another, with an odde one at the end, ſomewhat like vnto Aſhen leaues, but farre larger, and not ſo many on a ſtalke, ſmooth, and ſomewhat reddiſh at the firſt ſpringing, and tender alſo, of a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable good ſent, but more ſtrong and headie when they growe old: the fruit or nut is great and round, growing cloſe to the ſtalkes of the leaues, either by couples or by <pb n="595" facs="tcp:15790:304"/> three ſet together, couered with a double ſhell, that is to ſay, with a greene thicke and ſoft outer rinde, and an inner hard ſhell, within which the white kernell is contained, couered with a thinne yellow rinde or peeling, which is more eaſily peeled away while it is greene then afterwards, and is as it were parted into foure quarters, with a thinne wooddy peece parting it at the head, very ſweete and pleaſant while it is freſh, and for a while after the gathering; but the elder they growe, the harder and more oily: the catkins or blowings are long and yellow, made of many ſcaly leaues ſet cloſe together, which come forth early in the Spring, and when they open and fall away, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſtalkes ariſe certaine ſmall flowers, which turne into ſo many nuts.</p>

                     <p>They are often ſerued to the table with other fruits while they abide freſh and ſweete; and therefore many to keepe them freſh a long time haue deuiſed many wayes, as to put them into great pots, and bury them in the ground, and ſo take them out as they ſpend them, which is a very good way, and will keepe them long.</p>
                     <p>The ſmall young nuts while they are tender, being preſerued or candid, are vſed among other ſorts of candid fruits, that ſerue at banquets.</p>
                     <p>The iuyce of the outer greene huskes are held to be a ſoueraigne remedy againſt either poyſon, or plague, or peſtilentiall feuer.</p>
                     <p>The diſtilled water of the huskes drunke with a little vinegar, if the fits growe hot and tedious, is an approued remedy for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The water diſtilled from the leaues, is effectuall to be applyed to fluent or running vlcers, to dry and binde the humours.</p>
                     <p>Some haue vſed the pouder of the catkins in white wine, for the ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſtrangling of the mother.</p>
                     <p>The oyle of Wallnuts is vſed to varniſh Ioyners workes. As alſo is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted farre to excell Linſeede oyle, to mixe a white colour withall, that the colour bee not dimmed. It is of excellent vſe for the coldneſſe, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and contracting of the ſinewes and ioynts, to warme, ſupple, and to extend them.</p>
